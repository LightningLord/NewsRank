Lynch began his holdout Friday in hopes the Seattle Seahawks will upgrade his deal, which has two years and $13 million remaining. But the precedent such an upgrade would set is perhaps the most important reason the Seahawks don't seem interested in appeasing their star running back with more money. \"It's a contract for a reason. We made a decision and it was signed, by us and by them,\" Carroll told USA TODAY Sports after the Seahawks' first training camp practice. \"We expect them to honor their contract just as we will. We're going to honor it and we expect them to do the same. … \"We've had a big plan for a long time working here, and Marshawn is a huge part of that plan, and we made a huge commitment to him a couple years ago. He remains a big part of that plan – if he'll show up. The same thing will carry over to Doug (Baldwin) and Richard and Earl and Kam (Chancellor) and all of the guys that have signed with us.\" Carroll said he doesn't have any idea when or if Lynch might show up. He faces a $30,000 fine for each day he misses and partial signing bonus forfeiture if his absence reaches six days. USATODAY Saints' Jimmy Graham content to be 'an all-pro tight end' \"He's got his own mind on this,\" Carroll said. \"We've communicated quite a bit, and I know where he is on it and we just have to see what happens.\" The four-year, $30 million contract Lynch signed in March 2012 already has paid him $17 million. The $7.5 million average per year remains among the top six for NFL running backs, even after Kansas City's Jamaal Charles got a raise following his own holdout threat with the Chiefs this week. Lynch's deal has been surpassed on his own team, though. Thomas signed a new five-year, $44.7 million contract in April. The next week, Sherman signed a five-year, $57.4 million deal. Percy Harvin got a six-year, $67 million deal last offseason. All three contracts rank among the top deals at the players' respective positions for now. But with the salary cap rising in concert with NFL revenue, there figures to come a time those players may not be happy with their cash flow either. If the reigning Super Bowl champions depart from the plan and redo Lynch's deal now, how can they say no to the next star player who asks? \"Obviously, we want Marshawn here,\" quarterback Russell Wilson, who's next in line for a lucrative contract extension, told USA TODAY Sports. \"He's a great friend of mine. He's a guy who works so hard. It's one of those things where we want him here, for sure. \"But it's also a great opportunity for Robert Turbin, who's an unbelievable running back. He's strong, physical, fast, quick. Christine Michael, too, a young guy. We're excited about seeing those guys step up to the plate and see what they can do.\" USATODAY Players union: NFL 'on the verge' of 2014 season without HGH testing Turbin took the first rep with the Seahawks' starting offense Friday. Michael mixed in as well. It raised memories of a year ago, when Harvin was a surprise scratch for the first day of training camp last year and ended up undergoing hip surgery that cost him almost the entire season. \"It isn't about one guy. It hasn't been,\" Carroll said. \"We have a lot of really good football players here, and the opportunities for the guys to take advantage of that spot is extraordinary and they're going for it. I think that's a really good illustration of how our language was last year with Percy, our language is now again, because that's what we believe.\" The Sept. 4 opener against the Green Bay Packers is still almost six weeks away. And Wilson said he believes Lynch will be there. \"I definitely expect that and hope so,\" Wilson said. \"He's a competitor. He's a guy who wants to play, a guy who loves the game of football, a guy who loves his teammates. We love him to death, too. We pray and hope that he's here, just because he's a great friend and great teammate.\" If Lynch is set on returning with a raise, though, he may be waiting for a while.

What's one measly burglar? According to Breann Bierman of CBS 5 in Phoenix, the WWE superstar arrived home with his wife, WWE diva Brie Bella, to realize it was being burglarized. He pinned down one of the suspects until authorities were on the scene: Phoenix police said former wrestler Bryan Danielson, who goes by Daniel Bryan, and his wife were pulling into their carport in the Arcadia area about 7 p.m. on July 24 when two suspects dropped their loot and ran out of the house. Phoenix police said they broke the back door to get into the house. Danielson caught one of the suspects, 22-year-old Cesar Sosa, and was able to detain him until police officers could take him into the custody. Phoenix police are still pursuing the second suspect. Most of professional wrestling's critics are of the opinion that superstars like Bryan aren't really athletes and what they do is fake. While the wrestling is scripted, many of WWE's stars have trained in mixed martial arts or another form of martial arts. When the situation calls for it, they can lock on some debilitating submission holds. Perhaps even more impressive is that Bryan has been on medical leave from WWE since having neck surgery in May. He's not even fully healthy but still capable of dishing out a little vigilante justice. At the time of his departure, Bryan was the World Heavyweight Champion, having won the title at WrestleMania in a Triple Threat match against Orton and Batista. This is an entertaining story that luckily didn't take a turn for the worse. Professional athletes have been targeted by burglars before. Sometimes, in the case of Bryan, the incident comes to nothing. Others, like former NBA veteran Antoine Walker, aren't so lucky. Walker was robbed inside his home at gunpoint in 2007. Bryan will likely be a little shaken up by the close call, but he can rest easy knowing that no serious harm was done and no property was stolen.", "score"=>191.24165, "summaryTitle"=>"Daniel Bryan Stops Burglary Attempt at His House", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Daniel Bryan  has single-handedly taken down  Randy Orton , Batista and The Authority.

YouTube, meanwhile, has been taking lots of", "content"=>"Streaming music service Spotify is thought to be preparing to go public later in 2014 , but there's an alternative: getting bought by a bigger technology company. One in particular is in the frame: Google. Technology news site Recode reported on Monday that Google's current chief business officer, Omid Kordestani – who describes himself on his LinkedIn profile as the company's \"business founder\" – is joining Spotify's board of directors . A day later, the Wall Street Journal claimed that Google has already tried to buy Spotify , late in 2013, before being put off by the company's desired $10bn+ price tag, as well as Google boss Larry Page's \"lack of enthusiasm for subscription entertainment services\". Recode followed up with a dismissal of that report – \"there have been neither formal nor informal discussions between the companies about an acquisition, directly or indirectly\" – but the amount of smoke around the question suggests at least a spark, ready to ignite at some point. Why would Google want to buy Spotify though? Here are a few reasons why this particular rumour is being taken seriously within the technology and music industries. 1. Spotify is the biggest subscription streaming music service I've chosen those words carefully, because the world's biggest streaming music service is YouTube – a big chunk of its 1bn monthly visitors are watching music videos – while even if you discount videos, SoundCloud (which claims to reach 250m monthly listeners) is arguably the biggest audio streaming music service. But Spotify has 40m active users and 10m paying subscribers , with the latter figure making it the biggest brand in subscription-based streaming music. That's double the paying customers of rival Deezer (5m), while rivals like Rhapsody (1.7m), Beats Music (unknown) and Rdio (likewise) are some way behind. If a big company wanted to get into streaming music, snapping up one of those smaller fish – as Apple did with Beats Music – is a sensible option. But if someone wanted to make a splash and pick up the biggest brand, Spotify is the obvious choice. Why Google might not buy: The biggest subscription music company comes with the biggest price tag: Google may be one of the richest technology companies in the world, but that doesn't rule out rejecting $10bn as too much to pay. Google recently bought personal radio app Songza. 2. Google has been in the market for a streaming acquisition Yes, even though it already owns YouTube and is working on launching a paid subscription option for music on it. Yes, even though Google also owns Google Play Music All Access, a direct competitor to Spotify launched out of its Android business. Oh, and yes, even though Google paid a rumoured $39m for Songza , another streaming music service, earlier this month. That's three streaming music services and counting, even if Songza is different: a \"personal radio\" service based on themed playlists rather than Spotify-style \"on demand\" listening. \"Music industry sources say Google is in the market for a streaming music service and has been quietly surveying the landscape as the sector explodes,\" suggested a report in the New York Post in early June, citing fears within Google that \"Spotify gets so big no one can catch them\". This month's Recode and Wall Street Journal stories both suggest that YouTube's new boss Susan Wojcicki – a Google veteran – may be most open to the idea of buying Spotify, while news this week that the executive in charge of YouTube's upcoming subscription service is leaving the company suggests that the company's strategy isn't as set-in-stone as you might expect. Why Google might not buy: It could spend several billion dollars fusing its existing streaming services into a powerful single player instead. Songza could be the final piece in that puzzle, not a stepping stone to a Spotify acquisition. 3. Spotify has good relationships with the music industry Google's relationship with the music industry has been challenging, to say the least. Industry bodies like the UK's BPI and US' RIAA have been attacking Google for years over the role its search engine plays in online piracy . YouTube, meanwhile, has been taking lots of flak recently for the contract it sent out to independent labels for the upcoming subscription service. Indie trade bodies WIN and Impala have filed a complaint with the European Commission about this, claiming their members are being bullied into signing an unfair contract with the threat that their videos will be removed from YouTube if they don't. Beyond these specific rows, though, there's a simmering distrust of Google within many quarters of the music industry, even though there is also recognition of the hard work being done by some within the company: the creator relations people at YouTube and the team running Google Play's music aspects. Spotify? A number of musicians have criticised the company publicly, but when it comes to labels and publishers, it has a much better reputation. That includes many independent labels, stretching back to the way Spotify signed a deal with their licensing agency Merlin before it launched, including giving it some equity in the company. Within the industry, Spotify is seen as a \"good actor\" by more people – not just major labels – than Google. Buying Spotify could be an (admittedly expensive) way of rebooting that relationship. Why Google might not buy: Rather than improve Google's reputation, buying Spotify risks being seen in some quarters as an axis of music-value-destroying evil (see this piece from music industry attorney Chris Castle – one of Google's fiercer critics from the music world – for an early glimpse of that backlash.) Spotify has signed up more than 10m paying subscribers. 4. Spotify understands subscription-based entertainment Larry Page may have a \"lack of enthusiasm for subscription entertainment services\", but it's also fair to suggest that his company has a lack of experience in making those kind of services work. YouTube has had subscriptions available for individual video channels since May 2013, but they don't appear to have set the online world alight. Google Play Music All Access' figures are unknown. Android's Google Play app store might have paid out $5bn to developers in the last year , but Apple paid out $10bn from sales of apps and in-app purchases to a much smaller number of customers. In short, Google's strength remains making money through advertising, not subscriptions or purchases. Spotify has nearly six years' experience in a subscription entertainment business, including figuring out how to turn non-paying ad-funded users into paying customers. That knowledge could be hugely valuable to Google beyond music, if the company is serious about these kinds of models. Why Google might not buy: It has the resources to hire in a bunch of people who DO understand subscription entertainment. Also, there's the question of whether Google's CEO will rule out a move in that direction, as per the WSJ report. 5. Apple is preparing to make its big move in streaming music Apple's big move in streaming music wasn't launching iTunes Radio , another personal radio service, and it wasn't agreeing to pay $3bn for the parent company of Beats Music . It's what happens next: how iTunes Radio and Beats Music sit alongside one another (or, as seems more likely, merge) and roll out around the world. From CEO Tim Cook down, Apple executives have a mantra when it comes to music being \"part of Apple's DNA\", even if music is actually less important than apps nowadays in both direct revenues for Apple, and the indirect ability to sell more devices. iTunes remains the biggest music downloads store in the world, but there is growing evidence that music downloads may have already peaked and tipped over into decline, hastened by the growth of streaming. $3bn spent on Beats suggests Apple's move to counter that threat will be big and bold. Why does this mean Google might buy Spotify? Because if Apple throws its weight behind Beats Music – imagine the potential for bundling a subscription into every iOS device – one way for Android to battle that would be with the biggest streaming music brand in the world. Why Google might not buy: Google Play Music All Access could and should be Android's launchpad to compete with Apple on music, if the smartphone war moves in that direction. Or YouTube's new service, of course. Could Mark Zuckerberg beat Larry Page to buy Spotify? Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images 6. If Google doesn't buy Spotify, Facebook might Online chatter about a company's forthcoming IPO can be just what it seems: information leaking out about a forthcoming IPO. But it can also be mightily useful for smoking out potential acquirers who might want to whisk in with a big offer before it goes public. So, Spotify. For several years now, Facebook has seemed the more obvious ultimate exit for Spotify and its investors. The two companies have had a tight relationship since before Daniel Ek was the only digital music executive to appear on-stage with Mark Zuckerberg as he announced the company's new \"open graph\" platform in September 2011, and in tech mogul Sean Parker they share an investor and senior adviser. There are two notable strands to Facebook's recent corporate strategy: its willingness to take big bets on acquisitions ( $1bn on Instagram , $2bn on Oculus VR and $19bn on WhatsApp ) and its moves towards \"unbundling the big blue app\" on mobile devices , launching what Zuckerberg has described as \"single-purpose first-class experiences... the best tools to share with different size, groups and in different contexts\". If Facebook decides music is one of those single-purpose experiences it needs to own, Spotify would be the logical choice. And the prospect of a Facebook-owned Spotify might be just the thing to nudge Google into making its own offer for the company. See former CEO Eric Schmidt's admission in 2009 that the company deliberately overpaid around $1bn for YouTube because \"we believed that there would be a competing offer\" for past evidence of its willingness to move quickly in these situations. And then think about why it might be useful to have your chief business officer on the board of the company you might want to acquire before rivals... Why Google might not buy: Well, why Facebook might not buy – its appetite for multi-billion acquisitions may have eased for now. While Google's YouTube overpayment worked out well, that doesn't mean Page and co would stump up over the odds for Spotify in any bidding war. 7. Google might be the answer to Spotify's profitability challenges Spotify is growing fast: up from 24m users and 6m subscribers in March 2013 to 40m and 10m respectively in May 2014. But the company still looks a long way from being profitable: it pays out 70% of its income to music rightsholders as royalties, and its losses increased from €45.4m in 2011 to €58.7m in 2012. Streaming music is a financial sinkhole, as much due to the costs of expanding globally and the technical costs of hosting and streaming the music as to the royalties. The companies involved – Spotify included – see this as a necessary step towards a future where the economics do start to work, but there is still a big debate about when (or whether) this will happen. This is why Spotify might sell to Google, rather than why Google might buy Spotify. But if there's any sense that, several huge funding rounds down the line and with the prospect of going public bringing even more public scrutiny of its economics, Spotify might be open to an acquisition, that may nudge Google into action. Why Google might not buy: It has plenty on its hands grappling with music industry economics with the YouTube subscription service. Also, struggling with profitability isn't a barrier to Spotify going public: in the US, personal radio service Pandora has made regular losses, while Twitter is a prominent non-music example. • Five big challenges looming for Spotify and streaming music • Strong growth for streaming in 2013, but global music sales fell • What's next for Spotify?

No “gross one-person selfies.” Nina gets annoyed when people post them online and she wasn’t going to be one of those people, so she pulled our production manager, Geoff , into the shot. 2. It’s all about the angles, darling. Nina may have been born with God-given good looks, but girlfriend knows how to work her angles. Just look at those cheekbones! (Sadly, Geoff didn’t get the memo.) 3. Let there be light. Nina plays a vampire, so she knows how deadly bad lighting (or light, period) can be. And, lest MTV’s editors think Geoff inserted himself into the selfies because a) he was hoping for his 15 minutes of fame and b) who doesn’t want to snap a pic with Nina Dobrev, the actress recorded a video to set the record straight.

It's May 27, 2008. He's in San Antonio, where he's been living part time for most of the past two decades, launching one start-up after another: used-car dealerships, restaurants, lawn-care companies, rental properties. He thinks that once you know how to manage one sort of business, the skills are basically transferable. Case in point: Arturo recently, through a complicated series of events, acquired the rights to a film script written by a notable American screenwriter. It's potentially a very valuable script, and although Arturo has no prior experience in the business of making movies, he'd like to try to get this one produced. He answers the phone. The voice on the other end of the line is tight and panicky. \"Arturo,\" he hears his younger brother say, \"these motherfuckers have me, and they're going to kill me unless you give them the fucking screenplay.\" Benedict Fitzgerald arrives for lunch at the Fairmont Hotel in Santa Monica wearing a blue blazer over a button-down shirt and a battered baseball cap pulled down low. He never takes the cap off, and occasionally leans forward and looks around as he talks to make sure nobody's listening in. Fitzgerald, sixty-five, is a good storyteller, and there are a lot of great old stories he could tell you about himself. He could tell you how when he was three, he snuck into the big 1940's Mercury belonging to his father, the former poet laureate of the United States, then slipped it into gear and drove it straight into a brick wall. And he could tell you how his family's sometime babysitter, who happened to be the author Flannery O'Connor, memorialized the incident with one of her perfect phrases, describing Benedict clambering out the car window smiling, \"looking like Lindbergh.\" He could tell you how when he was nineteen, he took his junior year off from Harvard and apprenticed himself to Marcel Marceau in Paris, then parlayed his pantomime skills into a gig as an occupational therapist at an insane asylum, teaching the fundamentals of mime to lunatics. And he could tell you how one afternoon, a giant Danish psychopath skipped up to him after class, beaming, then darted his hands around his neck and didn't stop squeezing until the orderlies pried him off. He could tell you how when he was twenty-seven, he wrote a screenplay adaptation of his old babysitter's first novel, Wise Blood, and how he and his brother somehow convinced John Huston, the director of The Maltese Falcon and The African Queen, to come out of retirement to make it. And he could tell you how the resulting critically acclaimed film gave rise to a bohemian and star-crossed stint as a promising young screenwriter, which inevitably gave rise to more stories, such as the night he found himself watching Richard Burton put on an impromptu dinner-party recital of King Lear. All these great old stories. But the most astonishing story Fitzgerald has ever been a part of isn't an old one. It began a few years ago, and, well, it hasn't really ended yet. It's a story he's never told before today, a story that spans Hollywood and western Mexico and central Texas, a story fueled by ambition, tinged with desperation, and spiced with a kidnapping. The story begins with a job offer from Mel Gibson.   How could he say no? He had been living in Italy with his wife and three young daughters when the call came. It was early 2001. They'd moved to Perugia from Los Angeles two years prior, in part because Fitzgerald wanted to give his children the gift of bilingualism, but also because Italy was a cheaper place to live, and he wasn't exactly flush. Wise Blood had been a critical darling, but it hadn't made him much money. He'd carved out a shallow niche in Hollywood writing screenplay adaptations of heavy literature\u0097televised versions of Moby-Dick and Heart of Darkness and In Cold Blood, among others\u0097but nothing had ever really taken off. The last project Fitzgerald worked on prior to departing for Italy was a failed attempt to adapt The Iliad into a miniseries. The project had been considered by Mel Gibson's company, Icon Productions, and Gibson and Fitzgerald had met briefly. They had hit it off, Fitzgerald thought, but he was still surprised when the phone rang years later and he picked it up to hear Mel's low Aussie burr in his ear, telling him he was planning to direct a movie about the death of Jesus Christ and that he wanted to talk to Fitzgerald about writing it. Fitzgerald flew to California and spent several days with Gibson hashing out their vision of how they could make the old story feel alive again. After Fitzgerald returned to Italy, Gibson's company made him an offer. Fitzgerald's agent looked it over and advised him to pass. The age of religious epics was long gone, he said, and there was no way this one would be a success. Also, his agent thought the contract wasn't a good one, that there was too little money being offered up front and too little action on the back end. Benedict heard him out, but he knew he was going to sign. He spent much of the next six months in his study, in his house in Perugia, on a hill above the Tiber. He read the gospels over and over. He steeped in religious history and studied the mechanics of scourging and crucifixion. Eventually he booted up Final Draft on his IBM ThinkPad and began to write. He wrote with energy and enthusiasm. He wrote too long and too messy, but he didn't know what to cut, so on a quiet afternoon almost halfway through September, he attached his first draft to an e-mail and sent it off to Gibson. Right after pressing send, he noticed that the television in his study was showing a news feed of a single burning skyscraper in New York City, and then he watched in horror as the second plane hit. He didn't hear back from Gibson for several months, so in early 2002 he hand-delivered a leaner second draft to the Icon Productions office in Los Angeles, and a couple of days after that his phone rang and he heard Gibson's voice again, telling him the revised script had moved him to tears. The next two years were amazing. The late nights at Mel's home in Malibu, sharpening the arc, cutting the fat. The stormy shoot in Italy, during which the actor who played Jesus was grazed by lightning and one of the assistant directors was hit twice. The day on a soundstage in Rome when Fitzgerald watched the crew film Gibson's hands in close-up as he used a hammer to drive a spike through Jesus' palm, an impromptu and uncredited cameo that the director explained he'd done because \"there are two parts of me.\" The sheer exhilarating camaraderie of it all. The feeling that he was in the game again, working with top talent, on a story that mattered. And the film was a hit. A huge one. The Passion of the Christ began making headlines even before its release, when its leaked script was denounced by the Anti-Defamation League for perceived anti-Semitism, but the controversy didn't keep viewers out of theaters. It opened wide in February of 2004 and eventually took in more than $600 million and became the most profitable independent film of all time. The pope held a screening at the Vatican. Fitzgerald's agent had been totally wrong about the film's potential. He'd been right about the contract, though.   In the wake of The Passion of the Christ, Fitzgerald found himself in an unusual position. He had just written a blockbuster, but it was so controversial that it didn't exactly lead to a flood of new Hollywood writing gigs. And he needed new gigs. Gibson had paid him $100,000 to write the script and also advanced him a $75,000 production bonus prior to the beginning of the shoot. He did receive additional payments when the film hit theaters and went to DVD and cable, but they were smaller than he'd imagined, in part because the contract Fitzgerald signed denied him the standard Writers Guild of America pay scale, since he was residing outside of America when he signed it. Fitzgerald needed money. He had no job and no prospects. But he had an idea.   There is a common misconception about the Immaculate Conception. Most think it refers to the conception of Jesus Christ inside his mother's womb. After all, his mother was allegedly a virgin, and virgins are symbols of purity, and to describe something as pure is just another way of saying it is immaculate. So wouldn't an immaculate conception be one in which no sex took place? But the Immaculate Conception refers to the conception of Jesus' mother, not Jesus himself. This doesn't mean that her parents did not have sex. It just means that she somehow managed to grow from zygote to child-rearing age without acquiring the original sin that afflicts everyone else. She was an immaculate woman, which made her uniquely suitable for bearing the son of God. How could Fitzgerald follow up the huge success of The Passion of the Christ ? He would write a prequel. Myriam, Mother of the Christ. An immaculate woman coming of age in a sinful world, fleeing her home with her husband and her baby, shielding the child from brutal legionnaires and a jealous king. It made for a great story. Maybe it would make for a great movie, too. Fitzgerald's motivations were not immaculate, of course. But they were not entirely mercenary, either. Even the name of the project, his decision to call her Myriam, which is the original, Hebrew version of Jesus' mother's name, had a certain noble motivation behind it. For one thing, it is the name by which the Koran refers to her. The Prophet Muhammad actually placed Myriam above his own daughter, Fatima, making Myriam a shared object of worship between two religions, Islam and Christianity, that historically have had trouble finding much common ground. Add to that the fact that Myriam was basically the ultimate nice Jewish girl, and Fitzgerald thought that a movie about her, if it were as successful as the one he had just written about Jesus, might actually do some good at forging bonds among the three major monotheistic religions. This was maybe naive, but it wasn't mercenary. Likewise, Fitzgerald planned to allocate a portion of the eventual profits of the film to fund the Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of nuns who care for the needy elderly around the world. If everything went well, he stood to earn a great deal of money, and maybe even do a little good while he was at it. Everything did not go well. He leans across the table, lowers his voice. \"A lot of bad people got involved,\" he says. \"A lot of very dangerous people.\" Arturo Madrigal is wearing a black jacket and a checkered shirt and he wants to sit at the far end of the empty café in San Antonio where we meet. He asks for water, not coffee. He's got short, thick dark hair combed back, a vague widow's peak, and a smile that doesn't really carry weight because of the sheen of nervous sweat he's got going. \"I don't trust nobody,\" he says. He puts his phone on the table. It's in a red-and-black case with a Ferrari horse logo on it, and he's placed black electrical tape over the holes for the front and rear cameras so the lenses can't pick up any light at all. This is to keep the DEA agents he assumes are listening in on his phone conversations from being able to see him. It's the day before Christmas Eve, 2013, and most of his family is down in Mexico, and if things were normal, he would be down there with them, but things haven't been normal for a long time, ever since the thing with the movie. For Madrigal, the thing with the movie began on May 16, 2006, in a Tex-Mex restaurant on the north side of San Antonio, when he and three other men sat down to make a deal. They were a motley crew. The flashiest man in the room was Mauricio Sanchez Garza. He had a thing for nice suits and expensive watches. He was from Guadalajara, Mexico, though now he divided his time between there and San Antonio, flying back and forth on his family's private Learjet. His father was a prominent real estate developer, and the family had long been suspected by the U. S. Justice Department of being actively involved in laundering drug money for the Guadalajara cartel, though the suspicions had never led to formal charges. In recent years, Sanchez Garza had become the frontman for his father's growing business interests north of the border. The quietest man in the room was Arturo Madrigal, the serial businessman who was also from Guadalajara. Recently, many of his business investments had been made in partnership with Sanchez Garza. The most cheerful man in the room was Jorge Berlanga. He was the former husband of a Mexican pop star, Rocío Banquells, and had a lot of friends in the entertainment business on both sides of the border. One of them had made the introductions that made this meeting happen. And the most hopeful man in the room was Benedict Fitzgerald. This meeting was the culmination of his two-year-long attempt to secure financing for his prequel to The Passion of the Christ. Unlike the first film, he was hoping to hold the reins on this one and to reap more of the rewards if it became a success. He didn't pretend to be an expert at the movie business, but he trusted his longtime lawyer, who had agreed to help Benedict get this film made in return for a 50 percent stake. His lawyer had introduced Fitzgerald to Berlanga, and Berlanga's friend had introduced them all to Sanchez Garza and Madrigal. Fitzgerald wondered a little bit about the source of the Mexicans' wealth, but he didn't wonder too much. The four of them eventually went to Sanchez Garza 's large house in an upscale gated community called the Dominion, where they gathered around a computer and hammered out a one-page \"memo of agreement.\" The memo\u0097between Madrigal and Sanchez Garza's company, Macri Inc., and Fitzgerald's company, Myriam LLC\u0097included a number of bullet points. Fitzgerald had a nagging feeling that he should have insisted his lawyer come along on this trip to review the memo before he signed anything. But he kept coming back to the fourth bullet point. 4. Macri Inc. will hereby guarantee that within 120 days it will raise the full budget financing for Myriam, Mother of the Christ, which sum will not exceed $30,000,000 (thirty million US dollars). How could he say no? He signed.   Madrigal won't say today whether he and Sanchez Garza were already intending to wrench the script away from Fitzgerald. But within five weeks of signing the memo, he and Sanchez Garza filed a lawsuit against Fitzgerald in the Superior Court of California. The complaint was twenty-nine pages long and alleged a variety of transgressions, including fraud, breach of oral contract, and breach of duty to negotiate in good faith. The crux of the complaint was that Fitzgerald, after leaving San Antonio, had requested and received funds in order to secure Caleb Deschanel, the cinematographer of The Passion of the Christ, as the director of Myriam, and then did not secure those services. The complaint used this failure as grounds to demand that Myriam LLC return all the money it had received from Macri Inc.\u0097$340,000 at that point\u0097along with any \"such other and further relief as the court may deem proper.\" The case would drag on for two years. In the end, although there wasn't any concrete proof of fraud, the lawsuit itself was concrete proof of a failed partnership, and in order for Macri Inc. and Myriam LLC to be able to extricate themselves from the rubble, certain fiduciary issues needed to be cleared up. Specifically, the $340,000 would have to be returned. The problem was that the money no longer existed. It had dispersed in various directions: A $50,000 payment had been made to Jorge Berlanga, representatives had been sent to scout locations in Israel, Spain, and Morocco, a former DreamWorks producer had been hired to draft a comprehensive production budget, and preliminary attempts had been made to secure various cast and crew. And most of the rest, ironically or comically or tragically, had gone into paying the lawyers' fees to defend the case. Fitzgerald did not have the money to pay what he owed. But he did have something valuable. In late May 2008, after several sessions of court-ordered mediation, Fitzgerald agreed to sign over to Macri Inc. all rights to the script for Myriam, Mother of the Christ.   During the limbo of their slow-winding lawsuit, Madrigal and Sanchez Garza had plenty of time to discuss their plans for the movie. There was something great, they both agreed, about the fact that their first venture into Hollywood wouldn't be just some action flick or comedy. As Mexicans, as Catholic Mexicans, this was the sort of project\u0097a movie about Madre Maria!\u0097that could make their own mothers proud. But by the time the lawsuit was nearing its end, things had changed. Sanchez Garza no longer was as keen to go through the delayed gratification that accompanies making a movie. He'd found a potential buyer, a Hollywood producer, who was offering about a million dollars for the script. He thought that as soon as the script was in their hands, they should off-load it for as much as they could, sell the rights, and move on. Madrigal, on the other hand, wanted to keep the script and actually make the movie. The two argued, but it soon became clear that arguments were not going to sway either one of them. On May 25, 2008, about the same time that Fitzgerald agreed to give up his rights to Myriam, Sanchez Garza phoned Madrigal and promised physical harm to him and his family if he didn't, in turn, sign over his portion of the screenplay. Madrigal refused. Two days later, on the afternoon of May 27, 2008, Madrigal picked up the phone and heard his younger brother's tight and panicky voice on the other end of the line. His brother eventually passed the phone over to his kidnappers, who instructed Madrigal to fax them a formal letter relinquishing the rights to Myriam, Mother of the Christ to a man he'd never heard of named Jorge Vazquez Sanchez. Madrigal sat down and wrote the letter, then went to a Kinko's to fax it. He remembers the fear and anger he felt standing at the counter, waiting until the little receipt came back verifying that the fax had gone through. When she answers the phone at her office in Beverly Hills, Mary Aloe is talking as if she's already in the middle of another conversation, or a series of them. I finally manage to introduce myself, then she gets distracted by another caller and puts me on hold. Our conversation goes on like this for a while, whirling in quick, tight, confusing circles, making no forward progress. Eventually, I string a few sentences together, let her know I'm working on a story about what happened to the screenplay of Benedict Fitzgerald's prequel to The Passion of the Christ. Mary Aloe is the producer who, three weeks after Madrigal's brother was released by his kidnappers, agreed to purchase the screenplay from Mauricio Sanchez Garza and Jorge Vazquez Sanchez. She paid them $1 million along with ten points on the gross. Aloe puts me on hold again, and when she comes back to the phone, she's managed to patch in her attorney, Richard Rosenthal. The two of them immediately start telling me that I shouldn't waste my time on the story. It's ancient history, they say. I tell them that I don't see how the fact that a story happened in the recent past makes it any less of a story. Aloe apologizes but says she's got to catch a plane to London and that we'll have to talk at another time. And then she is gone. I try to get in touch with others who know Aloe and had been involved in the project. Shortly after one such attempt I receive an e-mail from Rosenthal insisting that my reporting \"CEASE AND DESIST.\" Over the next five weeks, we make several different interview appointments, and she cancels each at the last minute. Finally, we connect and are able to talk. But first she wants to make one thing absolutely clear: She wasn't part of the Cartel, had nothing to do with the kidnapping, and was blindsided by all that stuff. \"You don't go out and purchase a religious script thinking that you're going to have Scarface show up,\" she says.   Mary Aloe is forty-five now. Her career in entertainment began when she left the University of Southern California in the late 1980s and began writing for magazines, including Us Weekly. She soon left print journalism to work as an associate producer for Geraldo Rivera, gathering skills that she eventually put to use producing projects on her own. She executive-produced her first movie in 2001\u0097 The Princess and the Marine, about a romance between a Bahraini Muslim and an American Mormon\u0097and followed up with an eclectic string of pictures such as Numb, a 2007 romantic comedy with Matthew Perry, and Battle in Seattle, a dramatization of the 1999 WTO protests. None of her films have had more than cursory theatrical releases. It's easy to imagine the excitement she felt when she heard that the rights to the prequel to the most successful independent film of all time were on the market. She recalls that her first meeting with Mauricio Sanchez Garza and Jorge Vazquez Sanchez took place in a lavish suite at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas. Vazquez Sanchez never spoke, at least not in English. Sanchez Garza, however, charmed her. She remembers him gushing about his family, about his wife and kids. She was under the impression that he was some sort of real estate magnate. She never entirely understood how he and his silent business associate wound up in control of Fitzgerald's script, she says, but it was very clear that they were looking to make a deal. Aloe returned to Los Angeles and hired a copyright attorney to research the provenance of the script, and after three and a half months of due diligence he came back and said it was clean. Aloe had a second meeting with Sanchez Garza, this time by a fireplace in the lobby of the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills. She made the deal.   One of the first things Aloe did after securing the rights was to change the name from Myriam, Mother of the Christ to Mary, Mother of Christ. More accessible, more familiar. Then she dug into the script. Fitzgerald's telling of the story was somber and cerebral, and his action scenes\u0097for example, the scenes depicting Myriam and Yosef and Yeshua fleeing Bethlehem just ahead of the Roman legionnaires storming in to kill all the newborns\u0097were punctuated by recurring verbal sparring between the Archangel Gabriel and the fallen angel Lucifer. Aloe, on the other hand, envisioned the film as a young-teen adventure story. In a written summary of the project, she described the film as \"a linear ticking clock, high-action drama, faith-based, youth-based biopic.\" She also, unlike Fitzgerald, thought that the movie needed movie stars. Several big names emerged as casting possibilities. Al Pacino as Herod! Peter O'Toole as Symeon! Johnathan Rhys Meyers as Lucifer and Gabriel! Julia Ormond as Elizabeth! The financing agreements she circulated included stipulations regarding the licensing of \"action figures and other promotional merchandise\" related to the film. She brokered a deal with Joel Osteen, the most mega of American mega pastors, to add him as an executive producer. She admits she was focused a lot, maybe too much, on marketing and branding in those days. People who spoke with her back then recall her estimating that the film might net as much as a billion dollars. So it's easy to imagine what it felt like for Aloe in 2011, in the thick of preproduction, when a couple of DEA agents flashed their badges at her, laid out photographs of Mauricio Sanchez Garza and Jorge Vazquez Sanchez, and started asking questions.   After his brother was kidnapped, Arturo Madrigal did something he knows Mauricio Sanchez Garza never expected him to do: He went to the cops. Madrigal doesn't want to volunteer exactly what happened next, but a 2011 DEA warrant to search Sanchez Garza's house makes things pretty clear. The warrant hinged on information provided by a confidential informant, identified only as CS1, who according to court documents \"has conducted numerous consensually monitored and recorded conversations with targets of this investigation.\" Although the informant is not identified by name, the document notes that \"Mauricio Sanchez Garza and Jorge Vazquez Sanchez, through the Sanchez money laundering organization, extorted the rights to a movie entitled, Mary Mother of Christ, also referred to as Myriam, Mother of Christ, from CS1, a business partner of Mauricio Sanchez Garza. Mauricio Sanchez Garza extorted the CS1 by orchestrating the kidnapping of and threatening to kill the CS1's brother.\" The warrant also notes that CS1 \"has been a confidential source for the DEA since 2008\" when the kidnapping took place. The investigation eventually led to a wide-ranging federal indictment in 2010 against both men, charging them with extortion and funneling millions of dollars in cartel-sourced drug money into businesses and properties around San Antonio. In the wake of the indictment, Mauricio Sanchez Garza fled the country. He's still at large. Jorge Vazquez Sanchez pleaded guilty and received a seven-year federal sentence for extortion. That sentence was later reduced, for reasons that are sealed, to four years. The United States government also seized various possessions belonging to the two men: a Hublot Geneve Big Bang men's watch, a 9mm Glock pistol, a Bombardier Learjet, a variety of real estate around San Antonio\u0097and the rights to 10 percent of the future profits of Mary, Mother of Christ. The government's involvement in the Hollywood-epic business, however, was short lived. Madrigal quickly filed motions arguing that the government's stake in the film rightfully belonged to him, since it had been illegally extorted. On April 17, 2013, a judge agreed and ordered the rights transferred back to him. Today, Madrigal worries about what Jorge Vazquez Sanchez might do when he gets out of prison this year, just like he worries that once the DEA begins to tap your phone, they never stop. But he says he doesn't regret anything. When Madrigal recalls the last telephone conversation he ever had with Mauricio Sanchez Garza, after all pretenses between them had dropped, he smiles broadly at the memory of the last words he ever uttered to his former business partner. \"Chinga tu madre,\" he said.   It's hard to get a movie made under the best of circumstances, and Fitzgerald's script had become hopelessly, impossibly tainted. Aloe resigned herself to the idea that it could never be made. This was not an easy idea to come to terms with. She had thrown herself into the project, had given it everything she had, and now was left with the prospect of nothing at all. For a while, she wallowed. Then she decided to start over from scratch. She recruited a former nun turned screenwriter named Barbara Nicolosi, and together they wrote what they say is an entirely new script about the Virgin Mary. Joel Osteen remains as an executive producer, and he is expected to help market the film to his millions of followers. Now Aloe is in the process of pulling together a new cast and crew. She has signed on Lionsgate to distribute the film if she gets it made. She insists she has found investors and that the film is currently in preproduction. She's even got a poster, a tagline\u0097\"You Will Believe\"\u0097and a hoped-for release date: Easter 2015. She also says she wishes I weren't writing this article. She worries that drawing attention to what happened to Benedict Fitzgerald's script won't do her current project any good. And she wants me to know that the real story, the positive one I'm overlooking in favor of the muddy one about extortion and laundered money, is the story of how she and her team picked up the pieces and forged ahead. Like her film, Aloe considers herself in many ways reborn. \"When I first got involved, it was more about branding and money and all of that,\" she says. \"I had to find my own faith, and become a better person.\" Almost everyone I've spoken with about Aloe has described her as being aggressive, abrasive, a pit bull. But nobody I've spoken with believes Aloe knew that the men she purchased Fitzgerald's script from were kidnappers and money-launderers. And by all the evidence, she has left that script behind. In any case, one key element of the original project has definitely changed: After replacing Myriam, Mother of the Christ with Mary, Mother of Christ, Aloe has decided to shorten the title even further. Now it's just called Mary.   The last few years have been up and down for Fitzgerald. After losing the rights to Myriam, he found himself in the same shaky financial position as before, only worse. In 2008, he sued Mel Gibson, alleging that Gibson had paid him less than he was due for The Passion of the Christ. Gibson was ordered to give a deposition in the case, and when he showed up, he nodded at the man who'd written his most successful film. \"Hey Ben,\" he said. \"It's been too long.\" Then, just as the deposition was getting under way, Fitzgerald coughed. Gibson turned to Fitzgerald's attorney. \"Could you please ask your client to refrain from making noises while I talk,\" he said. \"Ask him to act like a man, please.\" Fitzgerald's lawyer questioned Gibson for two and a half hours. The conversation was a curious mix of ruminations about authorship and outright hostility. \"I don't write,\" Gibson said at one point, before explaining why he nevertheless deserved credit as coscreenwriter on the project. \"It was my vision,\" he said. \"It's my film. I made it. It changed as I shot it. It would change, and that's writing.\" A little later he added that \"any monkey can type keys.\" When Fitzgerald's attorney produced a draft of the screenplay for The Passion of the Christ and asked Gibson to indicate how it differed from Fitzgerald's first draft, Gibson said he couldn't recall. \"I've written a lot of scripts since then,\" Gibson said. \"He hasn't. One of us is prolific.\" \"I'd like the record to reflect,\" Fitzgerald's attorney said, \"that the witness, in a fit of anger, just flung the script across the table.\" The deposition continued for a while longer, but during the next recess Fitzgerald left the room and didn't go back. In 2009, he and Gibson settled. The terms were not disclosed, but the fact that Fitzgerald filed for bankruptcy in September 2012 probably tells you everything you need to know about how much he received. Today, Fitzgerald says he's trying to put it all behind him. He claims he has no interest in Mary Aloe's project. He wants to move on. One thing Gibson was definitely wrong about: Fitzgerald has been prolific. He's written several new screenplays since Myriam. He hasn't sold any of them yet. But he hasn't stopped writing. He recently finished a new script. Like his first-ever script, this one is an adaptation of another one of his former babysitter's stories, perhaps her greatest, \"A Good Man Is Hard to Find.\" It's a story about a peaceful American family road trip that is interrupted by a serial killer. The screenplay is dark and brutal and sometimes even funny. Throughout there is the pervading sense that evil is never that far from goodness, and that sometimes both are sides of the same coin. He thinks it might be the best thing he's ever written. He enjoyed writing about Myriam, and her son, too, but one of the challenges of doing so was that they were so pure, so perfect, so immaculate. Still, he feels that this whole rough passage he's been on has brought him closer to his faith, and to what he sees as its message of hope and forgiveness. During the last few minutes of our meeting, Fitzgerald tells me about his dream project. His father, Robert Fitzgerald, the former poet laureate of the United States, was also a translator, and his most famous translation was of Homer's Odyssey. Benedict and his siblings own the rights to it. He'd like to turn it into a screenplay, or a series of screenplays. He thinks he can breathe new life into his father's words. He believes that he understands the trials of Odysseus on a level he never did before. He also believes he knows the perfect person to direct it. He'd like to try to set up a meeting with Mel Gibson. previous story 17 Photos of the Adorable Dogs We Need to Save View All Follow Esquire Magazine on RSS and on Twitter at @Esquiremag .

Dubbed the Fire phone, it's offered exclusively through AT&T, and can either be purchased through the carrier or Amazon itself  for $200 with a two-year contract.   The phone didn't get great reviews overall . Business Insider checked out half-a-dozen New York City AT&T stores to see how the phone's were doing on their inaugural day. Here's what we saw and heard: Generally, there was a huge range of preparedness across the different stores. At one of the first ones we visited, every AT&T employee donned a Fire phone T-shirt, there were two phones on display for testing, and several huge ads. At another, smaller store, the phone hadn't even arrived yet even though it was 3:30 p.m., and employees said that they had shirts, but hadn't started wearing them yet. One sales person told us that the phone was mostly tailored to readers, because of the screen-size and good Kindle integration. We gave him the review unit Amazon gave us to test and that was his first look at the device. One salesman in Manhattan admitted that he had hardly touched the phone yet. \"It just came in today,\" he said. The main features he saw on first glance, however, were its enhanced 3D-like graphics and powerful camera. Few people had come in asking about it, nor had any sales been made. “We’re giving it a few days to test out,” he told us. When asked, he added that he made no commission for selling the Fire Phone specifically.  Other reps also said that there was no commission, too, though one referenced a small employee rewards program for selling the Fire phone. It's not a monetary bonus, but we did hear something like a free trip might be involved. One store manager told us that he'd definitely seen an uptick in foot-traffic asking about the phone in the week before the launch. He liked selling it because it \"catered a little bit to everyone,\" highlighting the gaming experience for the younger crowd and  the Mayday butto n, which offers 24-hour video tech support for the less technologically savvy. He also said that they'd sold two so far that day on his shift, between mid-day and 2 p.m. Personally, he chose to make the phone his new work device, and loved it. He admitted that it definitely made him shop more.  In a different store, a rep said he had hardly tested out the phone, and had made zero sales. He said that he thought Mayday was the most important feature, and beyond that, nothing seemed to stick out.  One customer, who was at the AT&T buying a new iPhone 5S, admitted that he'd never heard of the Amazon phone. He preferred iPhones over anything else because of their simplicity and power.   An AT&T rep in the same store said he hadn't sold any phones yet that day, but expected to sell at least three by the end of the day. He said that in the week prior, three people had also come in for pre-orders, which his store could fulfill. Two were in their fifties, and one was in his twenties.  Several sales reps admitted that they get people in asking about the iPhone 6 all the time, even on the Fire phone's launch day. All in all, it didn't seem like there was huge excitement for the new phone, from either sellers or customers.

At first, the official reaction from Israel appeared sanguine. \"Brazil is a friend, but we think its position is not balanced,\" Israel's general consul in São Paulo, Yoel Barnea, said according to the Wall Street Journal , adding that Israel should have a right to defend itself from the thousands of missiles being fired at it by Hamas and other Palestinian groups. Things soon took a turn for the worse. “This is an unfortunate demonstration of why Brazil, an economic and cultural giant, remains a diplomatic dwarf,” Israeili Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said on Thursday, the Jerusalem Post reports . “The moral relativism behind this move makes Brazil an irrelevant diplomatic partner, one who creates problems rather than contributes to solutions.” That insult wasn't the worst that Israel had reserved for Brazil, however. In an interview with the Brazilian media, Palmor brought up the most humiliating moment in recent Brazilian history –  this summer's stunning World Cup semifinal loss to Germany. \"Israel's response is perfectly proportioned in accordance with international law,\" Palmor said in an interview with the Jornal Nacional TV show late  Thursday. \"This is not football. In football, when a game ends in a draw, you think it is proportional, but when it finishes 7-1 it's disproportionate. Sorry to say, but not so in real life and under international law.\" Brazil's foreign ninister, Luiz Alberto Figueiredo, hit back at the \"dwarf\" insult. \"We are one of 11 countries worldwide that have diplomatic relations with all UN members, and have a history of cooperation for peace and international actions for peace,\" Figueiredo said in an interview with CBN radio . \"If there are any diplomatic dwarfs, Brazil is not one of them.\" There doesn't appear to have been a comment on the 7-1 jibe yet. Brazil, which has a large Jewish population, has historically had good relationships with Israel. However, its 2010 decision to recognize a Palestinian state  hurt relations between the two nations. Brazil was one of 17 countries to vote for a UN' Human Rights Council proposal for an investigation into allegations of Israeli human rights violations during the current conflict in the Gaza Strip. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the vote \"a travesty\" and said it \"should be rejected by decent people everywhere.\"   Adam Taylor writes about foreign affairs for The Washington Post.

While many around the league have been highly critical both of Rice's conduct and of what's been perceived as a lenient punishment, ESPN panelist Stephen A. Smith sought to temper that criticism during a \"First Take\" segment on Friday. In a long-winded statement, Smith acknowledged a man has \"no business putting [his] hands on a woman,\" then slowly worked toward the conclusion that women should also do their part not to give men a reason to beat them. \"We know [abusing women is] wrong,\" Smith concedes, though toward the end of his monologue he casts doubt on who, exactly, is to blame for said abuse, given \"the elements of provocation.\" Michelle Beadle, a female ESPN host, tweeted a response to Smith's statement, alluding to the rationale of a rapist who believes the victim asked for it by wearing provocative clothing: In February, after TMZ obtained security camera footage of Rice dragging his unconscious fiancée out of an elevator, Smith, while critical, ultimately defended the player at the time. \"It's important to recognize and reiterate [that] we do not know what happened ... inside that elevator,\" said Smith, concluding, \"There is absolutely nothing ... that has ever brought [Rice's] integrity into question until now. ...

Their websites both use canvas fingerprinting, a newer form of online tracking designed to make it hard to hide. ProPublica investigated the pervasive shadowing method, developed as an insidious alternative to cookies so websites can keep tabs on where their visitors browse online. The Princeton and KU Leven University researchers who first uncovered canvas fingerprinting titled their paper about it \" The Web Never Forgets ,\" and estimate that 5 percent of the top 100,000 websites use this method to trace user movements online, including Whitehouse.gov, Perez Hilton, PlentyOfFish, Rap Genius, CBS, and yep, YouPorn. So how does it work? Canvas fingerprinting gets its name because it instructs web browsers to draw a hidden image, and each computer produces a slightly different, unique image. Like a fingerprint. A creepy fingerprint that wants to follow you online. Once your browser draws the hidden picture, the information is relayed to the website. It uses your unique image to assign a number to your computer and develop a user profile to better sell targeted ads. Canvas fingerprinting was invented in 2012, and a company called AddThis developed code used in 95 percent of the cases. Don't want to get fingerprinted? Canvas fingerprinting is an especially sinister form of online tracking because you can't use AdBlock Plus or your standard web browser privacy settings to get around them. Incognito mode is no match for canvas fingerprinting, which is bad news for everyone trying to keep their porn viewing habits on the DL by clicking the Incognito button. They know what you've seen. If you want to avoid canvas fingerprinting, ProPublica pointed out a few methods. You can use the Tor network to go online anonymously and avoid all sorts of tracking. You can use NoScript , a Firefox web extension, to counter tracking, although you'll have to look up which sites are kosher each time you want to unblock Java or another script they run, which will be both time-consuming and not entirely certain. There's a website that lists all of the top sites currently using canvas fingerprinting, so you could check sites against that, but it may not be updated frequently enough to catch new offenders. You can also download Chameleon , a browser designed to avoid this kind of tracking, but it's still a low-key experiment, and not very user-friendly unless you're comfortable setting stuff up from Github. Another option: blocking JavaScript from your browser altogether. That's going to seriously mess up your experience on a lot of websites, so I don't recommend doing that. If you've accepted your fate as The Tracked but don't want the data used for ad targeting and profile building, you can manually sign up for opt-outs from the businesses doing the tracking. AddThis would be the big one, since it does most of the known fingerprinting. It's both telling and disturbing that the only real work-arounds are inconvenient and incomplete. But until someone finds a way to step up and stop it, at least you can know which sites are violating the little privace you have left online.

White Locked In: In the days of free agency, it's so rare to see a player spend his entire career with one team, but that's the way things are shaping up for WR Roddy White , who penned his name to a four-year contract extension just before XFINITY® Atlanta Falcons Training Camp kicked off. White had a little zip in his step during the first session of camp Friday and it was likely a product of getting some big business out of the way. \"When I first actually got to the league, I just wanted to play five years. It's crazy. It's just over time, you get to this point, it's been really, really good, man. We've won a lot of games, especially since (head coach Mike) Smith got here. It's been a heck of a ride, and I just hope it continues to be this way and we just continue to win games.\" 2. Waiving Johnson Opens Up WR Spot: The announcement Friday just before the first session of camp that the Falcons have parted ways with WR Darius Johnson means that the door for young wide receivers has swung wide open. Smith wouldn't give any reasoning behind the move to waive Johnson, but said that there is a huge opportunity now for players like Bernard Reedy , an impressive undrafted WR, as well as some of his teammates: \"I think that opens that up to a lot of competition. I think there's a number of positions that there's gonna be some very intense competition and I think that back end of the wide receiver position now is wide open. I think there'll be a couple of young guys that probably weren't in the mix that are probably going to get into the mix now.\" 3. Passion Shows in Biermann and Matthews: We usually get to the dog days of camp before there's an on-field scuffle, but fans didn't have to wait long as defensive end Kroy Biermann and rookie offensive tackle Jake Matthews traded a few jabs around the midway point of Day 1. Biermann and Matthews were on each other all day and a push turned into a shove, and so on. For Biermann, there was the excitement of having some true contact for the first time since his Achilles injury. For Matthews, it was a chance to prove that there's not anyone he'll back down from. Overall, Smith expects to see more of that: \"I imagine we'll have some of those types of battles all through training camp. Those things are good. I think it keeps it spirited, and we're gonna have spirited football practices here in Flowery Branch up to the start of the first game.\" 4. Clap It Up for Julio: Friday marked the much-heralded return of Julio Jones to the field since he was lost for the 2013 season after a Week 4 injury, and fans were eager to see him. There were many occasions when fans found themselves applauding each of Jones' accomplishments on the field Friday, from the easiest catch to a couple of impressive moves. He's on a schedule of on-again, off-again as his action at camp will be throttled to save him for the season, but Smith said it was good to see him back again: \"I thought it was very good. You guys saw it. He was running routes very well. I thought the timing between he and Matt was very good. We have a plan, a prescription that we're going to try to stay by for the first couple of weeks and then we'll make an evaluation after that.\" 5. Falcons Will Pad Up This Weekend: The day you've all been waiting for is Sunday, July 27, and that's when the Falcons will finally come out to practice in full pads.

The 19-year-old, who can play right-back, centre-back or as a midfielder, has long been regarded as one of the top young prospects in English football and the Gunners have now won the race for his signature, agreeing a fee in the region of £16 million. Chambers is understood to have already had a medical, ahead of signing a deal at the Emirates. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers wanted to take the teenager to Anfield, but Chambers has instead opted for north London and the opportunity to link up with Arsene Wenger. Chambers had four years left on his current deal but had his head turned once Arsenal made their move, with Southampton realising it would be difficult to shun the interest from one of the Premier League's top clubs. New Saints boss Ronald Koeman was keen for Chambers to remain at St Mary's and challenge Nathaniel Clyne for the right-back spot, but the Dutchman has reluctantly accepted the deal is going to go through. Chambers will be the latest Southampton star to depart the club this summer following the exits of Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert to Liverpool, while Luke Shaw has also left for Manchester United.

Called Coinye West, the altcoin was subsequently renamed Coinye in an attempt to continue its business activities even in the face of legal pressure. The developers envisioned Coinye as a fun and simple altcoin for the hip-hop community, and even tweeted news about its development to the rapper in the hopes he would embrace the concept. This plan backfired, however, as Kanye West sued the Coinye team on 8th January , starting a lengthy legal process that has been ongoing since this time. The resulting legal onslaught even caused the closure of one exchange involved with the coin’s planned launch. Originally announced  on 3rd January  and arriving shortly after the meme-based dogecoin, Coinye arguably arrived at the height of the altcoin industry’s more irreverent phase. Despite the legal challenges, the coin maintains an active Bitcoin Talk thread and reportedly still trades on some exchanges under the ticker symbols COYE or KOI. Thou shall not mock Kanye The altcoin met its end at a New York courthouse earlier this week when the 10 defendants lost by default, never bothering to respond to the case,  according to  Ars Technica . Three of the defendants, David McEnery, Harry Wills and Richard McCord settled with West. Under the terms of the settlement they are permanently banned from operating or using any website that uses the “Kanye West mark” or any imitation of it. McCord’s lawyer said he was not even involved in the creation of the parody altcoin. McCord said it is “unfortunate that a parody turned into such an expensive endeavor”, and that he views the whole process as a learning experience. Parody taken to court It took Kanye less than a week to  unleash his lawyers against the creators of Coinye . The developers responded by changing the visual appearance of the coin and their homepage. The redesigned coin featured an even less flattering portrayal of West, depicted as a fish, inspired by a  South Park parody of West . The developers eventually decided to  kill the project altogether , but not before Kanye’s lawyers tried to drag them and anyone involved with the project to court. Robbie E.C.A. Hontele , who has denied any involvement with the coin’s development, but was an admitted user of the coin, has since signed a settlement agreement . Hontele was reportedly misnamed as one of the coin’s developers in a video, thus causing his involvement. Hontele told  Ars:  “I’m happy to see the blockchain is not mentioned in the verdict and that the settlement has been made without any admission of wrongdoing.” He concluded: “I will be celebrating tonight.”", "score"=>183.82857, "summaryTitle"=>"Kanye West Sues Coinye Altcoin into Oblivion", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Chicago rapper Kanye West has managed to kill an altcoin named in his honour, six months after it was launched by a team of developers.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.coindesk.com/kanye-west-sues-coinye-altcoin-oblivion/", "referrer"=>["btckan.com", "google.com", "direct", "netvibes.com", "t.co", "twitterrific.com", "facebook.com", "linkedin.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1tKFfGe", "lastseen"=>"20140726004534", "page"=>"http://www.coindesk.com/kanye-west-sues-coinye-altcoin-oblivion/", "ogtitle"=>"Kanye West Sues Coinye Altcoin into Oblivion"}, {"domain"=>"si.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406326339000", "site"=>"www.si.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004416", "keywords"=>"Erin Andrews, erin andrews fox, Erin Andrews WEEI, Fox Sports WEEI, Erin Andrews Adam Wainwright", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335456899", "title"=>"Erin Andrews WEEI controversy: Fox Sports to no longer advertise with radio station company that owns WEEI - More Sports - SI.com", "initial"=>"20140725221219", "summaryText"=>"Fox Sports is going all-in on a Boston sports-talk radio station that railed against Erin Andrews.  In a letter from Fox Sports president Eric Shanks today to David Field, the president & CEO of Entercom Communications Corp., Shanks said that Fox Sports", "content"=>"Fox Sports is going all-in on a Boston sports-talk radio station that railed against Erin Andrews.  In a letter from Fox Sports president Eric Shanks today to David Field, the president & CEO of Entercom Communications Corp., Shanks said that Fox Sports will no longer be advertising on Entercom's stations. The company is one of the largest radio broadcasting companies in the U.S., with over 100 stations in 23 markets. Fox Sports talent will also not be appearing on any WEEI show starting today. Wrote Shanks: By now you are no doubt aware of the incidents that occurred on-air at your Boston station WEEI on July 15 and again on July 22, I am referring to the obnoxious comments made by Kirk Minihane on the “Dennis and Callahan” show regarding one of our Fox on-air personalities, Erin Andrews.  As we have previously stated to various media outlets, the comments made by Mr. Minihane were boorish and sexist. Further, the “apology” made by Mr. Minihane was juvenile and insincere. To make matters worse, the “apology” was posted under a banner (allegedly approved by your Boston VP and Market Manager, Phil Zachary) hailing “The Triumphant Return of Kirk Minihane.” I had hoped by this time we might hear a sincere apology from WEEI, or perhaps someone from your office might have reached out to Fox (which through our film and television businesses is a significant advertiser on Entercom stations).  However, none of that has been forthcoming, and needless to say we are disappointed.  I have discussed this issue with our senior management and our various senior marketing executives. At their recommendation, I am writing to inform you that going forward Fox’s entertainment and sports businesses will not be advertising on your stations for the foreseeable future. I regret that we need to take this action, but as one of our executives reminded me, “sometimes you need to vote with your feet.” I trust you will discuss our decision with your staff at WEEI. On the morning following Fox's broadcast of the All-Star Game on July 16, WEEI's Kirk Minihane, an on-air staffer of the Dennis and Callahan Show, called Andrews a \"gutless bitch\" and told her to \"drop dead\" during a critique of her admittedly tepid questioning of Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright during Fox's coverage of the game at Target Field.  “What a bitch,” Minihane said. “I hate her. What a gutless bitch. Seriously, go away. Drop dead. I mean seriously, what the hell is wrong with her? First of all, follow up. Secondly, the guy admitted he did it. He told reporters he threw a couple of pipe bombs. So how is that social media’s fault?\" In a statement later posted to the station's website, Minihane apologized for his comments. He was then absent from the show for a couple of days for what the station said was scheduled time off to attend a wedding. The furor was a big story in Boston -- with state attorney general and democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha Coakley weighing in to reporters. “I think that’s pretty unacceptable in this day and age,” Coakley told Boston.com. “Here’s a professional woman, doing her job, obviously we can all be criticized for what we do but we should be able to do it without those kind of disgusting, uncalled for, and frankly outrageous comments.\" Upon returning to the program last Wednesday, Minihane apologized for his remarks before putting the television personality on blast again. \"I just feel like it was the wrong time to use that specific word to describe her,\" Minihane said. \"I will say this: I think she stinks at her job. I don't think she's very smart, I don't think she comes across as very smart. I think Fox only hired her because she's good-looking. I think if she weighed 15 pounds more, she'd be a waitress at Perkins. I mean, that's what I believe.\" Lewis Kay, the Los Angeles-based representative for Andrews, responded to Minihane on Twitter following the Perkins comments. \"I certainly hope you treat the women in your personal life with more respect than the way you treat them on your show,\" Kay tweeted. Fox Sports upper management -- many of whom have wanted to go public with their animus over the comments -- met on Friday afternoon at the company's Los Angeles offices on how to respond to WEEI after Minihane's second set of comments.

And perhaps most importantly, what can I learn from these quiet observers so that, when I send my next tweet, those 474 followers find a reason to click, reply, retweet, or favorite ? Meet social media’s invisible audience —and the inevitable questions that this crowd elicits. The invisible audience among my Twitter crowd and the invisible audiences on Buffer’s social media accounts (and even on this blog) offer a unique opportunity for us to consider how we craft our updates and our content . I’ll be happy to share how I think about this silent majority as well as some interesting research and rules about this topic. Is this a demographic you consider in your social media marketing ? Share in the comments, and read ahead for some insights, stats, and tips. Your audience is 4x larger than you think Posting to a social network site is like speaking to an audience from behind a curtain. The audience remains invisible to the user. While the invitation list is known, the final attendance is not. - Dr. Michael Bernstein, Stanford How many people do you think see your updates on Facebook? Chances are that your actual audience is much larger than you think. A joint research project by Stanford and Facebook studied the perceived vs. actual audience sizes of 220,000 Facebook users. Each user was asked what they believed to be the size of their audience, then the research team compared this perceived size to an actual size, using server logs to gauge the true scope of a post’s audience. The result: Your actual audience size is four times larger per post than what you think. Also of note is how these users came to gauge the size of their perceived audience. Researchers classified survey responses into eight different categories, and none of the eight involved a specific audience-size metric like impressions or reach. The top way we gauge our audience size: Guessing.   Takeaway: Our posts reach a much greater number of people than we think. And we haven’t quite figured out how to measure our audience size. Participation inequality: The 90-9-1 Rule Back in 2006, bloggers Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba coined a term to describe the ratio of activity in online forums: The 1% Rule, also known as the 90-9-1 Rule. 1 percent of users are creators 9 percent of users are commenters 90 percent of users are observers This image from Christopher Allen sums it up nicely: The rule has since been adopted across a wide range of Internet interactions , including social media. If you picture yourself in a group of 100 people, you are the creator, nine of the 100 people engage with your content, and the other 90 are just there to observe, read, and lurk. Here’s the thing with this rule, though: It’s not going to be 100 percent accurate for your audience. Paul Schneider tested the theory on his audience, finding a 70-20-10 ratio . The Community Roundtable noticed a split of 55-30-15 among their community . You’ll have your own ratio. For instance, in the example that I used to start this article, my Twitter ratio of participation inequality was closer to 95-4-1. Across our Buffer social profiles, I’ve noticed a similar split—4 to 5 percent engagement rate is fairly standard. So instead of taking the 90-9-1 rule as gospel truth, it’s best to think of it as a reminder that lurkers are in the majority, engagement is the minority. And this tends to be the norm for online communication. How large is your silent majority? To come up with your own ratio of participation inequality—and to see how many people truly view each of your updates and posts—you simply need to look at the numbers. Here’s how I found our ratio for Buffer’s social accounts and the Buffer blog. How to find your invisible audience on Twitter To check out your stats on Twitter, you can navigate to the new analytics dashboard at analytics.twitter.com . It’s quite beautiful, and super informative. From the main dashboard you can see your tweet impressions: the number of times users saw your tweet. Next to that is tweet engagements: all clicks anywhere on the tweet (including avatar, username, hashtags, links, and tweet expansion), retweets, replies, favorites, and follows. Then Twitter will even do the math for you with engagement rate: engagements divided by impressions. Your invisible audience is the difference between impressions and engagements, or the inverse of engagement rate. Here is a sample post from our Buffer analytics:   How to find your invisible audience on Facebook You can grab your ratio from Facebook in a similar way to Twitter. Go to your page insights (click on Insights at the top of any page you manage), and total up the Reach from your recent posts and the Engagement from your recent posts. Then divide engagement by reach to arrive at your engagement rate. You can also peek at an individual post to see its reach and then total up the likes and comments to gauge engagement. How to find your invisible audience on your blog Hop into your analytics dashboard and look for the unique visits to each post (in Google Analytics, you’ll find this under Behavior > Site Content). Then find the total comments on each post, divide comments by visitors, and you’ll get the comment rate. One of our most popular recent posts, Courtney’s list of free image sources , has brought a whopping 147,000 visitors to the blog and a whopping 116 comments. Interesting, the comment rate on this post—even with over 100 comments—is 0.08 percent. If we were to split up the 90-9-1 rule of participation according to this post’s comment numbers, the ratio might look like this: one creator, the big toe of a commenter , and the rest lurkers (and clickers and sharers)! In our experience, blogs have an even greater invisible audience than on social. 5 ways to respond to your invisible audience OK, back to the question that started out this article: What does your invisible audience think of your content? There’s no way to really know, yet that shouldn’t stop you from supporting this large group and thinking outside the box on ways to reach them. Here are five different ways I’ve found to do just that. 1. Go where your invisible audience is Have you heard of the phrase “dark social”? It’s a term that describes the sharing that happens outside the traditional bounds of social media. For instance, people may share via email or via IM, and these interactions are seldom included in traditional share numbers. A 2012 study from The Atlantic and Charbeat found that 69 percent of social referrals were from dark social—i.e., not Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc. If your invisible audience wishes to stay invisible on social media, could there be another place to find them? We’ve recently began looking deeper at email . Our stats show that the invisible audience size on email is smaller than it is on social. We can reach 27 to 40 percent of our email list of 35,000 each time we press send. Another interesting take on this is  the most-used apps by this year’s high school graduates . Texting is the far-and-away winner, with other interesting apps like Pandora and Netflix among the top ten. 2. Keep a consistent schedule One of the conclusions from the Stanford-Facebook study mentioned above was that a misperception about audience size could have a direct effect on one’s social media marketing. The mismatch between the size of perceived audience and the actual audience may be impacting users’ behavior, ranging from the type of content they post, how often they post, and their motivations to share content. The reasoning here is that a smaller perceived audience might cause sharers to decrease their volume of updates. If few people are listening, the temptation might be to post less often. Heidi Cohen advises to withstand the temptation . Keep a consistent schedule (a scheduling app like Buffer can help with this). Your invisible audience is likely much larger than you think, and they’re primed to keep hearing from you. 3. Invite participation Dan Zarrella’s popular social media research often references a consistent trend: If you ask for participation, you’re more likely to get it. This might look a number of different ways. For instance, Zarrella found that asking for a retweet actually increases one’s odds of getting retweeted—by up to 39 percent. 4. Stick to your guns (or your bio) How might you know what kind of content your invisible audience wants? One of my theories is that they’re likely to want what you’ve promised them—either via your social media bio , your blog mission statement, or your company/position/tagline. For instance, I’ve mentioned that you can expect tweets from me about writing as well as a handful of fun, curated links. I’ve likely gained a silent majority of followers who understand (and appreciate) that this is the type of content I’ll be sharing. 5. Rely on accurate metrics It’s tempting to look at clicks, shares, comments, and favorites and assume that those are the people reading and viewing your content. Remember, it’s likely that your audience is much, much larger. I’ve come to rely on a handful of different metrics to gauge the success of a piece of content. Above, I outlined how to view reach or impressions via Facebook or Twitter. Here are a few other social media and blog stats that I tend to focus on. Relative engagement rate – average conversations happening per post, per follower Follower/fan growth, week-over-week and month-over-month Time on site Social shares Over to you: How might you respond to your invisible audience? It’s clear that the silent majority on social media makes up a huge amount of the people seeing our tweets, posts, and updates. How might this invisible audience impact the way you share? I’ve found it’s important to stay on topic, post consistently, and track these silent impressions as accurately as possible. You may even find value in seeking out new places to find these quiet followers: email, direct message, forums, or even SMS. My one big thing: Keep this invisible audience in mind when you’re posting. Be their voice by remembering that they’re out there, reading, observing, lurking, and following—and doing so in much greater droves than we might think.

The largest amount of nerve endings may be packed into those areas, but she has pleasure sensors all over her body, and getting her in the  mood  may be as easy as stimulating some of these often-neglected parts. Incorporating touching these places into foreplay and sex, or just giving her some pleasure after a hard day, will definitely earn you some brownie points. 1.  Hair Maintaining their gorgeous locks isn’t the only reason women go to their hairstylists so often. The process of wash, cut, color, and styling can actually be quite a stress reliever. Running your hands gently through her hair is a surefire way to send tingles down her spine. Let your fingers massage circles from her temples to the nape of her neck and she’ll be putty in your hands. 2. Pelvis Concentrating some affection on her pelvis is a great idea; however, you’ll have to resist the urge to slip down to her vagina while you’re so close. Like teasing her inner thighs, kissing and licking around her pelvis will excite her until she’s begging for more. Prolong the sensation by leaving the region to focus on another body part for a while. 3. Inner Thighs Touching her inner thighs without venturing into the vaginal area will make for an excellent tease that is sure to get her revved up. Use your hands and mouth to caress and kiss the insides of her thighs, getting excruciatingly close to her ultimate pleasure spot, but pulling back before going all the way. 4. Feet Pulp Fiction taught us that rubbing the feet of another man’s wife may be an offense punishable by being thrown out a window, so the sensual appeal of a foot massage is obvious. There are few better ways to help her relax than to give her feet a good rub, especially if her job requires her to be on them all day. Do it right and grab some massage oil or lotion. Don’t forget to pay some attention to her toes, ankles and the sides of her feet too. Some women really enjoy having their toes sucked, but others find it repulsive, so asking first is a good idea before putting them in your mouth. 5. Earlobes Touching, kissing and even lightly biting the earlobes of your woman will up the bliss factor for her. These delicate, soft lobes are very sensitive and most women thoroughly enjoy the sensation of having a man’s lips on them. You can nibble around the outside of the rest of her ear as well, but for courtesy’s sake avoid jamming your tongue inside her ear. 6. Palms Of Her Hands People often use their hands as tools to please their partners, but rarely do they consider the pleasure potential of stimulating the hands themselves. The palm of a woman’s hand is an innocuous spot to focus a little attention on without making people around you uncomfortable. Tracing your finger along her palm will give her delightful shivers and make you appear sensitive and attentive. 7. Behind Her Knees This area is one that most men don’t think of when trying to stimulate a woman, but it is, in fact, quite sensitive. Gently caressing the back of the knee under her skirt while the two of you are in a public place will make her ready to get busy once you get home. Don’t forget to pay some more attention to this special spot once you’re alone too. 8. Small Of Her Back The best way to guide your woman through a crowd is to place your hand against the small of her back. This small gesture shows that you feel protective of her without being too pushy like an arm around the shoulder might be. When you’re alone, kissing or licking down her spine to end up with a kiss on the small of her back will get her heart racing. 9. Clavicle A well-defined clavicle, or collarbone, can be very sexy on a woman. Why not show your appreciation for its beauty with your touch and kiss? Pay attention to this body part while she’s still fully clothed, unbuttoning her shirt just enough to reveal the clavicle and no further. You can always come back to it once the clothes have disappeared as well to remind her of the anticipation it created when you started there. 10. Nape Of Her Neck Once you get to the nape of her neck, place a few light kisses there. In ancient Japan, the back of a woman’s neck was seen as very attractive by men since it was one of the few places not covered by clothing. In modern times, the nape of the neck is often neglected in favor of more obvious pleasure centers, but never underestimate the power of gentle touches and kisses from her hairline to her shoulders. 11. Everywhere Else Every inch of her body is covered with nerve endings that could be stimulated, but that doesn’t mean that she doesn’t have some no-go places. Some women can’t stand to have their faces touched, while others find it unbearable if their hands are tickled. As you explore, you’ll learn which places your touch has the best effect on and which you should avoid.

But when strength and conditioning coach Buddy Morris let the current group of Cardinals know it was time to go during Friday’s conditioning test, Mathieu (along with Cook and Ta’amu) ran as well. It wasn’t about the time Mathieu posted, and that was good – the safety later said with a smile he didn’t go as fast as he could have. “I didn’t want to come in here and steal the show,” Mathieu said. “I tried to chill. I saw B.A. (Bruce Arians) looking at me so I tried to slow down and not run as fast.” One of the major storylines of training camp will be Mathieu’s comeback. But Mathieu, like Ta’amu on the physically unable to perform list for now, might not get a chance to take part in camp. “Personally, I could play tomorrow,” Mathieu said wishfully, before allowing that at best he sees himself at least a month away or even 6-to-8 weeks. That would put his return right around the Cardinals’ bye week after three games will have been played, and right about the time Arians estimated when he addressed it at the end of minicamp. Arians said it would take Mathieu all of a “day” to be ready to play again. “He’s watching tape all the time and coaching (rookie safety) Deone (Bucannon),” Arians said. “It’s a matter of him getting healthy.” Arians doesn’t want to push Mathieu or Ta’amu either, he said. Mathieu said he can run well straight ahead, although he’s still about “50, 60 percent” in terms of cutting. Sitting on the side is not ideal, he admitted, but said he didn’t want to say he was depressed because he’s been truly depressed before and this is not that. “It’s when the team is coming together, picking leaders … it’s football,” Mathieu said. “It’s tough not being part of the game.” EXTRA POINTS Arians said LB John Abraham , the lone player absent, was excused for personal reasons and would be back as soon as he could. … Tight end Troy Niklas will wear a soft cast for now after breaking a bone in his hand in the offseason, but he has been fully cleared to play. … The Cardinals have their first practice of camp Saturday starting at 2 p.m. It will be open to the public, although padded practices do not begin until Monday.", "score"=>182.16402, "summaryTitle"=>"No Show Yet For Tyrann Mathieu&nbsp;", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Safety is on PUP but gets in some running as Cardinals open camp", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.azcardinals.com/news-and-events/article-2/No-Show-Yet-For-Tyrann-Mathieu/a7f4a65b-342c-4a27-a8e3-caa1395fcdc9", "referrer"=>["direct", "t.co", "sportsmanias.com", "azcardinals.com", "tweetlist.com", "bleacherreport.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1phixEq", "lastseen"=>"20140725235503", "page"=>"http://www.azcardinals.com/news-and-events/article-2/no-show-yet-for-tyrann-mathieu/a7f4a65b-342c-4a27-a8e3-caa1395fcdc9", "ogtitle"=>"No Show Yet For Tyrann Mathieu&nbsp;"}, {"domain"=>"mirror.co.uk", "initial_epoch"=>"1406324353000", "h2"=>["The 19-year-old made it clear to the Saints he wanted the move and will now battle Mathieu Debuchy to be Arsene Wenger's No.1 right-back", "Southampton face ANOTHER transfer raid as Jose Fonte is eyed by Cardiff to replace Caulker", "Liverpool close on Dejan Lovren deal as Reds agree £20million fee with Southampton"], "h3"=>["Free to play", "Get the Mirror Football App on iOS", "Compare online poker sites and get play tips"], "site"=>"www.mirror.co.uk", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004310", "keywords"=>"Southampton transfer news,Southampton FC,Calum Chambers,Arsenal transfer news,Arsenal FC", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335390225", "title"=>"Arsenal agree Calum Chambers transfer from Southampton for £7million fee - Mirror Online", "initial"=>"20140725213913", "summaryText"=>"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has swooped for Southampton right back Calum Chambers in a £7million raid.

We kill the stability in our dressing room. ‘Because when you pay that much to a 19-year-old kid — a good player, a fantastic player — the next day, me and (Chelsea director) Mrs Granovskaia and (technical director) Michael Emenalo get players knocking on our door and saying how is it possible that I play for this club 200 games and won this and that?

A Caltrans camera showed the man clinging to the side of a sign attached to the Downey Road overpass just before 4 p.m. He appeared to be holding a can of spray paint. A SigAlert was declared on the freeway at 4 p.m. and both sides of the freeway were shut down, according to the CHP’s online incident report. “Avoid area,” CHP’s Southern Division stated on Twitter.

CC BY-NC-SA 2.0. The decline of various animal populations and species loss are occurring at alarming rates on Earth, contributing to the world’s sixth mass extinction. While these deadly events may ultimately pave way for the emergence of new species, Stanford scientists have warned that if this “defaunation” that we are currently experiencing continues, it will likely have serious downstream impacts on human health. The study has been published in Science . Biodiversity on Earth is extremely rich at present; it’s estimated to be the highest in the history of life on our planet. But scientists have been recording species abundance and population numbers for some time now and it is evident that we are experiencing a sharp downward trend. While the extinction of a species is normal and occurs at a natural “background” rate of around 1-5 per year , species loss is currently occurring at over 1,000 times the background rate. Thanks to the fossil record, we are very familiar with large extinction events. Indeed, there have been 5 mass extinctions throughout the history of life on Earth, but there is a key difference between these past events and what is happening presently: humans are almost entirely to blame for the current mass extinction. Climate change, pollution, deforestation and overharvesting are all contributing factors . While it’s difficult to be certain of the causes of the previous mass extinctions, they have been attributed to natural events such as supervolcano eruptions and asteroid strikes. By reviewing literature and analyzing various data sets, scientists have found that since 1500, 322 terrestrial vertebrates have become extinct. The remaining species are also suffering a 25% average decline in abundance. Invertebrates are also experiencing a huge blow with 67% of monitored populations showing 45% average abundance decline. Among vertebrate species, it is estimated that up to 33% are threatened or endangered. Large animals, or megafauna, seem to be most affected, mirroring past mass extinctions. This is because large animals tend to have low population growth rates, produce few offspring and require large habitats to sustain viable populations. Loss of megafauna has various downstream effects and may eventually impact human health. For example, studies conducted in Kenya where patches of land were isolated from large animals such as zebras and elephants found that the areas rapidly became plagued with rodents due to increases in food availability and shelter. Concomitantly, the levels of disease causing pathogens that they carry also increases, thus enhancing the risk of disease transmission to humans. But it’s not just big animals that have an impact. Various insect species such as bees are valuable pollinators. According to a Cornell study , honeybees and other insects contributed $29 billion to farm income in the US in 2010. Furthermore, insects also play pivotal roles in nutrient cycling and decomposition, contributing to ecosystem productivity. Lead author  Rodolfo Dirzo hopes that raising awareness of the consequences of this ongoing mass extinction may stimulate much needed change, but acknowledges that solutions are far from simple given that approaches need to be tailored to individual areas and situations.  [Header image, \"Southern White Rhinocerous looks us over at Wildlife Safari near Winston Oregon,\" by Mary Harrsch, via Flickr, used in accordance with CC BY-NC-SA 2.0] Tags New Study Suggests Only 8.2% Of Our Genome Is Functional Next Prev Newly Discovered Gut Virus Is In At Least Half of All Humans", "score"=>181.18753, "summaryTitle"=>"Scientists Warn We Are Approaching The Next Mass Extinction", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"The decline of various animal populations and species loss are occurring at alarming rates on Earth, contributing to the world’s sixth mass extinction.

This matters not only to entrepreneurs raising capital — but it also impacts the finance industry overall, because companies are staying private longer (fewer IPOs) and public investors (including hedge funds,", "content"=>"The structure of the VC industry is changing. This matters not only to entrepreneurs raising capital — but it also impacts the finance industry overall, because companies are staying private longer (fewer IPOs) and public investors (including hedge funds, mutual funds, publicly held corporations) are getting into the VC game, too. So in that sense these changes affect everyone who is in the market. The changing structure of the VC industry was a huge topic at the recent PreMoney conference — and the focus of a discussion between me and fellow venture capitalist Mark Suster, which you can watch here and here . Mark also just wrote an excellent post discussing the structural changes; I highly recommend you read it. To summarize, some of the key observations include: the rise of small funds (they now account for 67% of all new funds raised in 2014); the concentration of capital among fewer, larger firms (10 firms accounted for 48% of total limited partner dollars raised in 2012, according to the NVCA); the decline in the number of VC firms with $100-500M in assets (this group represents only 18% of funds in 2014) — and the fact that companies are staying private longer (some of my thoughts for why are here ). But the real question is: Why now ? What’s really behind the structural transformation happening in venture capital — and by extension, the tech industry? And finally: How do we reconcile the seeming paradox of it being cheaper to start companies today… but at the same time needing to raise more capital? It’s cheaper to build companies now Much ink has been spilled on the very real decline in the costs of building technology companies. Some estimate as high as 100x decreases in the costs of storage, compute, bandwidth, networking, etc. in just the past decade and half. With the advent of AWS, DigitalOcean, Rackspace — and cloud-based technologies in general — technology startup costs are significantly lower today. A lot of entrepreneurs can’t even conceive of this now, but there was a giant slurping sound of dollars flowing from VC firms to the leading technology infrastructure companies during the time we were building Loudcloud (2000). Back then, a startup raised $5 million in A round financing (yes, in those days, A rounds were actually $5 million!) and that money traveled from the VC’s bank account to the startup’s bank account directly into the bank accounts of Akamai, BEA, Cisco, EMC, Exodus, Level 3, Oracle, and others. It’s important to note that all of this was up-front capital expenditure . Today, startups can pay as they go, scaling up their operating costs (vs. CAPEX) as needed, as their business grows. At the same time, advances in developer productivity tools (think Github) and programming languages (like Python ) have dramatically increased the efficiency of software development . In many ways, what previously took 100 developers can now take just 10. In addition, a consumer-facing startup that deploys its applications via the internet or as a mobile app gets customer distribution mostly free, at least initially. While Apple does charge a 30% tax on revenue that flows through the App Store, this is a success-based fee rather than an up-front sunk cost that must be borne regardless of revenue generation. Meanwhile, the proliferation of platforms such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter as customer acquisition channels makes it that much easier for new companies to experiment — with relatively small amounts of invested capital — on a product to see whether it gets initial market traction. This is not completely free, but it is still a very targeted and a more incremental (vs. up-front) way to acquire initial customers at relatively low cost. All of this explains the rise of small funds: It simply takes less money to get a company from conception to initial product launch to early customer traction (or not) than it has at any other time in history. But how does this explain the concentration of capital dollars in larger ($100-500 million) VC funds? Doesn’t that contradict the argument about how much cheaper it is to start companies today? Well, it turns out that, while it is in fact cheaper to get started and enter the market, it also requires more money for the breakout companies to win the market. Yet it takes more money to win the market End-user markets are much bigger than in previous decades. The internet population (now exceeding 2.5 billion) is 10x what it was in 1999, and rapidly growing around the world. Tablets have overtaken PCs as the compute medium of choice, but the real transformation is in smartphones. Of all the cellphones in use today, only 30% are smartphones. If you believe, as we do, that there will be a wholesale conversion of this remaining 70% to smartphones — which are really broadband-enabled supercomputers that we carry around with us at all times — the opportunity for successful companies to reach ever larger markets is unprecedented. This is is not just a consumer trend: Enterprise adoption of mobile technologies and the proliferation of SaaS as a software delivery vehicle means more users within companies and government agencies will deploy more applications than ever before. And the security, identity management, and core infrastructure needs to support these applications will grow accordingly. But the biggest transformation of all is in who can be reached. With potentially 5.9 billion users coming online — largely due to the developing world — we have the ability to reach global markets at a scale never before witnessed. Already more people have more access to mobile telephones than they do toilets . At the same time, the number of international markets that were once off limits due to geopolitical issues or high costs of entry is significantly smaller. The widespread penetration of mobile devices — and therefore applications — has also leveled the playing field. For example: 80% of Twitter users are international, and Facebook arguably has more international than domestic users if you include its reach through WhatsApp. The direction of innovation is starting to turn, too: Spotify successfully entered the U.S. market after having starting outside the U.S., and Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent are likely to do so as well over the coming years. Finally, we are seeing the rise of what my partner Chris Dixon has metaphorically described as the “full-stack” startup, where entrepreneurs want to own more of the full customer experience and are therefore building out expertise in areas beyond just tech. For instance, in a non-full stack world, AirBnB would have been a software company that developed a better customer matching and booking engine and then licensed that to multiple hospitality purveyors who would then own the customer relationship. Instead, the “full-stack” AirBnB owns the customer relationship end-to-end, and thus must build expertise in customer service, global operations, regulatory affairs, and so on. Perhaps more significantly, in a full-stack world, software companies can compete with their physical-world counterparts and build new and unexpected platforms that others can then build on. [More on full-stack startups here , here , and here .] Ultimately, today’s winners have a chance to be a lot bigger. But winning requires more money for geographic expansion, full-stack support of multiple new disciplines, and product expansion. And these companies have to do all of this while staying private for a much longer period of time; the median for money raised by companies prior to IPO has doubled in the past five years. It’s vastly more efficient for startups that anticipate needing significant capital to seek partners who have the capital and the resources to grow with their needs. *  *  * Much of the above explains why we are seeing the structural changes in the VC industry that Suster and others have described. But it’s important to note that these structural changes are not unique to the VC industry — this is a natural evolution that has occurred in nearly every other services-based business over the last 50 years. That is, a “death of the middle” occurs over time as service industries bifurcate into a smaller number of large, fully integrated, full-service institutions on one end and a larger number of smaller, niche-oriented institutions (with a focus on stage, industry, or specialized skillset) on the other. Look no further than investment banks, law firms, accounting firms, advertising agencies, buyout firms, talent agencies, and recruiting firms to see how this phenomenon has played out in mature services-based business. Interestingly, we are witnessing this right now in a non-services business as well: the U.S. retail market. Long-dominant department stores such as J.C. Penney and Sears are giving way to big-box retailers and etailers (Amazon, Best Buy, Target) at the large end complemented by large numbers of specialty, boutique stores at the smaller end. [Though in retail, betting “narrow” can be big as the internet allows companies to better segment and address previously unaddressed markets.] Despite how much venture capital firms invest in the most disruptive industries, the VC industry has itself been relatively staid from a structural perspective since its founding. With current trends as our compass and history as our guide, we can expect the industry to look a lot different in the next 10 years than it has in the previous 50. So, what should we make of all of this? For VCs and LPs, venture capital is alive and well and, more significantly, the return potential to private investors generally looks very bright. For entrepreneurs, this is the most exciting time not just to get capital from multiple sources — but to build companies with a long-term game in mind.", "score"=>181.04799, "summaryTitle"=>"Why the Structural Changes to the VC Industry Matter", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>"us-ca", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://a16z.com/2014/07/25/why-the-structural-changes-to-the-vc-industry-matter/", "referrer"=>["direct", "t.co", "lnkd.in", "bit.ly", "facebook.com", "linkedin.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1pk343D", "lastseen"=>"20140726004237", "page"=>"http://a16z.com/2014/07/25/why-the-structural-changes-to-the-vc-industry-matter/"}, {"domain"=>"chicagobears.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406322287000", "h2"=>["Two picks for Fuller in first practice", "Recent Articles", "Recent Videos", "Recent Photos"], "h3"=>["Popular", "Bears first-round draft pick Kyle Fuller intercepted two passes in his first NFL training camp practice Friday in Bourbonnais.", "Two picks for Fuller in first practice", "Bears put Long on NFI, Steltz on PUP", "Mills aims to take game to next level", "Trestman embracing high expectations", "Allen on the start of training camp", "Fuller diving interception", "Happy Birthday Walter Payton", "Back to work"], "site"=>"www.chicagobears.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004525", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335525537", "title"=>"Two picks for Fuller in first practice", "initial"=>"20140725210447", "summaryText"=>"Bears first-round draft pick Kyle Fuller didn't wait very long to make an impact in his first NFL training camp practice Friday in Bourbonnais.

The cornerback from Virginia Tech made a diving interception during the team's first 11-on-11 drill and later picked off a second pass and raced up the left sideline. Kyle Fuller returns an interception during the team's first 11-on11 drill at practice. \"It was a good start for Kyle,\" said coach Marc Trestman. \"That was a terrific play he made in the first series of the day. The second one, he got a wrong route and he was in the right place and made the play, and that's a good thing. He's around the football. It was a good start for him.\" Fuller's first interception came on a Jordan Palmer pass that was intended for Terrence Toliver . \"Just playing my technique and fundamentals, and when the ball's in the air just trying to make a play,\" Fuller said. \"Definitely a good start, but I've still got a lot of work to do.\" Fuller's second pick came on an errant Jimmy Clausen throw. Asked if the two takeaways will boast his confidence, the rookie cornerback said: \"You always can take that, but at the same time you have to make sure that you continue to get better. You can never get complacent.\" Just like during offseason practices, Fuller lined up as a starting cornerback in passing situations Friday opposite Charles Tillman with Tim Jennings moving to nickel back. \"Those guys are two great guys that I can go to if I have any questions,\" Fuller said. \"Just being a pro in all aspects, so that definitely helps me.\" Catch this: First-year receiver Chris Williams provided the offensive highlight Friday by hauling in a long pass from Palmer down the right sideline, beating Fuller by a considerable margin. The Bears signed Williams off the Saints' practice squad last Dec. 26 and are enticed by his speed and potential as a return specialist. The New Mexico product played three seasons in the CFL with the Hamilton Tiger Cats, setting a league record with six return touchdowns in 2012. \"Chris has done a good job as a receiver in practice,\" Trestman said. \"He catches the ball, he's got strong hands, and he finds ways to get open. He's made the most of his opportunities when the ball's been thrown to him. We'll have to see how that progresses. He's in a competition not just to be a returner here but to be a receiver here as well.\" Music men: The Bears played loud music during individual periods early in practice. Songs included \"Welcome to the Jungle\" by Guns N' Roses and \"Living on a Prayer\" by Bon Jovi. \"I've talked a lot about this with guys around the league,\" Trestman said. \"I just wanted to bring something to practice, just a little more energy. Talking to the players about it, that we would do some work in individual when we can coach them close up and still get our job done but have a little fun as well with just getting them going. \"And it translates to games because there's music before games. So because they're working with music before games, why shouldn't we have music during the same kind of warm-up period, that individual period that we have in practice? That was really the No. 1 reason to do it, to make the practice as game-like as it could be.\" Sights seen: Receiver Alshon Jeffery picked up Friday where he left off last season, making a handful of nifty leaping grabs. Fellow receivers Brandon Marshall and Marquess Wilson also looked sharp catching passes in 7-on-7 and 11-on-11 drills. … Cornerback Sherrick McManis intercepted a pass that deflected off receiver Josh Morgan . … Tight end Martellus Bennett dropped a pass and jumped before the snap on one series of drills. … Right guard Kyle Long (viral infection) and safeties Craig Steltz (groin) and Chris Conte (shoulder) did not practice.

His uncertain future aside, the wide receiver is still", "content"=>"Josh Gordon , Joe Haden , Jordan Cameron , Joe Thomas , Alex Mack Here are my top five Cleveland Browns players as the team prepares for its first practice of training camp Saturday: > Josh Gordon. His uncertain future aside, the wide receiver is still a member of the Browns. And on that basis, he is on this list. And he is at the top of this list because not only is he the Browns’ most talented player, he is arguably the best receiver in the NFL. If he is available to play for any portion of the season, the Browns are going to be a better team during that stretch. They will obviously miss him while he is not playing, but the degree to which they are able to weather his absence is unknown, considering that they will have a run-oriented offense and can turn to tight end Jordan Cameron and assorted veteran receivers to help fill the void. > Joe Haden. The Browns’ blitz-oriented, pass-rush-driven defense won’t work unless the cornerbacks consistently hold their own in man-to-man coverage. In Haden, the Browns have one of the league’s very best cover corners and he will, in fact, be a lynchpin to their entire defensive philosophy. That was reflected in the huge contract extension he received during the offseason. Whether there will be a cornerback opposite Haden who can be effective enough to allow the Browns to succeed with their high-risk/high-reward approach remains to be seen. Therefore, expect opponents to continue to do what they’ve routinely done against the Browns since Haden’s arrival: throw in the other direction. > Jordan Cameron. There is every reason to think that he will follow up his Pro Bowl season in 2013 with another big year. As the tight end demonstrated last year, he thrives from increased experience and knowledge. And during the offseason, Cameron received more intensive coaching on how to better read and understand coverages and defensive concepts. He is entering a contract year, so he is additionally motivated to perform at the highest level possible. If Gordon is out for any prolonged period, opposing defenses will no doubt be able to give Cameron greater attention, but he still should find ways to make game-changing plays in the tight-end-friendly scheme of offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan. > Alex Mack. Given the Browns’ new, outside-zone, run-blocking scheme, there will likely be greater influence on the performance of their interior linemen. And that starts with Mack, who has established himself one of the very best centers in the NFL. He will impact everything the Browns’ line does with his quickness and athleticism, along with his tremendous ability to communicate blocking assignments and adjustments to the rest of the line. > Joe Thomas. Some might question the seven-time Pro Bowl offensive tackle ending up fifth on this list, but it is hardly a sign of disrespect. Thomas remains one of the very best in the game at his position, but he achieved his status primarily as a pass-blocker. The Browns’ new offense will put greater emphasis on the run, and although Thomas should have the necessary physical skills to excel in the outside-zone scheme, less is likely to be asked of him than, for instance, a year ago when the team leaned heavily on its linemen to hold their blocks as long as possible to deal with the deeper quarterback drops that go with longer-developing pass patterns. >>Be sure to tune in Monday through Friday, 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. ET, for “Cleveland Browns Daily, Driven by Liberty Ford” on ESPN 850 WKNR or catch the live stream right here on ClevelandBrowns.com.

Curt Clawson (R-FL): When in a House hearing, you may want to know to whom you are speaking before saying anything to them. Otherwise it could get awkward or embarrassing. As Foreign Policy magazine pointed out on Friday , the freshman Republican lawmaker mistook State Department official Nisha Biswal and Commerce Department official Arun Kumar to be Indian government officials during a House Foreign Affairs committee yesterday. “I’m familiar with your country,” he told them, despite the chairman introducing them both as senior American officials. “I love your country. And I understand the complications of so many languages and so many cultures and so many histories all rolled up in one.” He added, as the two officials sat staring at him: “Anything I can do to make the relationship with India better, I’m willing and enthusiastic about doing so.” When he asked the pair for cooperation from “your government,” an awkward pause ensued before Biswal took the mic and told the Republican: “I think your question is to the Indian government. And we certainly share your sentiments and we certainly will advocate that on behalf of the U.S. government.” Foreign Policy reports more context on the mishap: It’s extremely uncommon for foreign officials to testify before Congress under oath. Even so, it’s unclear if at any point Clawson realized his mistake, despite the existence of a witness list distributed to the various members detailing Biswal and Kumar’s positions. Clawson’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. During the hearing, he repeatedly touted his deep knowledge of the Indian subcontinent and his favorite Bollywood movies. None of his fellow colleagues publicly called him out on the oversight — perhaps going easy on him because he’s the new guy.

But in a disturbing new preview clip for Teen Mom 2 , she admits to taking pills prescribed to her by a doctor, and how they made her feel like a “druggy!” Messer has struggled with having to take on a new job to help with her daughter Aliannah ’s medical bills and taking care of three children. She openly discussed how emotionally everything was taking a toll, and eventually went to a doctor who prescribed her pills that made her feel too loopy. “I’m about to start crying over here,” she told her husband, Jeremy Calvert in the new clip. “When I first take that medicine, I feel calm and I feel like I can do stuff. I took half of it this time instead of a full one and now I feel really messed up. Maybe it’s just me thinking about it too much.” “I feel like I’m about to start crying because I feel like . . . I’m on drugs and I’ve never felt like that ever in my life,” she continued. “I don’t like feeling like that. I feel like I’m slurring and I just feel really weird and I’m freaking out.” Calvert told her to call her doctor, but Messer said that her doctor had warned her her she would feel out of it until her body got used to the new pills. Calvert then pointed out that he thought that Messer was taking too strong of a dose – a full pill in the morning and at night — and that she maybe needed to take a smaller dose. “It helps me at first and then I start feeling like a damn druggy,” she said. Jeremy responded, “You can see if in your eyes right now.” “That’s what I’m saying: It makes me feel bad,” Messer continued. “I don’t want to feel slow. I don’t want to look like that. But I know that I need it because it helps me at first . . . then throughout the day, I feel worse.” The weird feeling made Messer feel conflicted. “It’s starting to make me sad because I’m not that type of person,” she said. “I’ve never took anything like that, so I’m starting to feel like, ‘What’s wrong with me?’” Calvert thought it was all because Messer had “too much on her plate.” “Just be there for me,” she concluded. “Be supportive.

Dave Filoni says that A New Hope came about because it was a fraction of a larger story that George Lucas had conceived. “You always feel like there are great stories left untold.” With the new streamlined and collaborative storytelling across Lucasfilm, those stories can be told. Pablo Hidalgo: “We really sketched out some pretty detailed backstories…in Rebels, we don’t do flashbacks.” With novels and other avenues, they can tell these past stories. 2:06: Miller says that Kanan, unlike Obi-Wan, has no mission — it makes him unique and interesting, which he enjoyed in writing A New Dawn.

Is there anything we can do? Yes. Naps. Wonderful, glorious naps. They're not a full-on substitute for lack of sleep but they can do much more than you think and in less time than you'd guess. Without them, you're going to be a mess. Here's why. Wanna be dumb and ugly? Lack of sleep not only makes you ugly and sick , it also makes you dumb: missing shut-eye makes sixth graders as smart as fourth graders . And if that's not enough, lack of sleep contributes to an early death. Starting in the mid-1980s, researchers from University College London spent twenty years examining the relationship between sleep patterns and life expectancy in more than 10,000 British civil servants. The results, published in 2007, revealed that participants who obtained two hours less sleep a night than they required nearly doubled their risk of death. [ Night School ] Maybe you think you don't need all that much sleep. You're wrong. Less than 3 percent of people are actually 100 percent on less than eight hours a night. But you feel fine, you say? That's the fascinating thing about chronic sleep debt. Research shows you don't notice it — even as you keep messing things up. In her TED talk, Sara Mednick, author of Take a Nap! Change Your Life , gives the rundown: Now here's the part you've probably never heard: Eight hours might not even be enough. Give people 10 hours and they perform even better . Timothy Roehrs and Thomas Roth at the Sleep Disorders Research Center of the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, have demonstrated that alertness significantly increases when eight-hour sleepers who claim to be well rested get an additional two hours of sleep. Energy, vigilance, and the ability to effectively process information are all enhanced, as are critical thinking skills and creativity. [ Power Sleep ] I know what you're thinking: 10 hours a night? I don't have time for that. I barely have time to read this post. Is there a compromise? Naps. Can closing your eyes for a few minutes really make that much of a difference? Keep reading. NASA says you should sleep on the job Research shows naps increase performance . NASA found pilots who take a 25 minute nap are 35 percent more alert and twice as focused. Research by NASA revealed that pilots who take a 25-minute nap in the cockpit — hopefully with a co-pilot taking over the controls — are subsequently 35 percent more alert, and twice as focused, than their non-napping colleagues. [ Night School ] Little siestas helped people across a whole host of measures . Improved reaction time, fewer errors… NASA found that naps made you smarter — even in the absence of a good night's sleep. If you can't get in a full night's sleep, you can still improve the ability of your brain to synthesize new information by taking a nap. In a study funded by NASA, David Dinges, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and a team of researchers found that letting astronauts sleep for as little as 15 minutes markedly improved their cognitive performance, even when the nap didn't lead to an increase in alertness or the ability to pay more attention to a boring task. [ Dreamland: Adventures in the Strange Science of Sleep ] Study after study has shown naps boost learning. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, found that napping for ninety minutes improved memory scores by 10 percent, while skipping a nap made them decline by 10 percent. [ The Little Book of Talent: 52 Tips for Improving Your Skills ] And naps make you happier . Studies show we can process negative thoughts quite well when we're exhausted — just not the happy ones. Negative stimuli get processed by the amygdala ; positive or neutral memories get processed by the hippocampus. Sleep deprivation hits the hippocampus harder than the amygdala . The result is that sleep-deprived people fail to recall pleasant memories, yet recall gloomy memories just fine. [ NurtureShock ] What's not to love? I know. You're busy. You'll just have another cup of coffee. Sorry, research shows naps beat caffeine . So how do you nap the right way? How do you get the results you want with minimal effort? Here's what science says. The perfect nap for you ( iStock ) Whatever your limitations and desires, there's a nap for you. Looking at research from Richard Wiseman and the WSJ , here's a breakdown. Which one describes what you need? 1) \"I just need to be more alert and focused\": Take a 10-20 minute nap. You'll get a boost in alertness and focus for two hours or more, pay off a little sleep debt, and even reduce blood pressure. 2) \"Brain no working. Need smartz\": Consider a 60 minute nap. You'll get all the benefits of the 10-20 minute nap while also improving memory and learning. But be warned: 60 minute naps cause grogginess. 3) \"I want it all , baby\": Take a 90 minute nap. This allows your brain to experience a complete sleep cycle. You'll get the full whack: increased alertness, memory, learning, creativity, and performance — with no post-nap grogginess. 4) \"I don't know what I want but you've scared me into napping and I don't have much time\": Go with 10 minutes. It beat five, 20, or 30 minute naps in a comparative research study . 5) \"I don't have enough time to tell you how little time I have\": No nap is too short : \"A 2008 study showed that even a nap of a few minutes provided benefits. Just anticipating a nap lowers blood pressure.\" Got more questions? I have answers: When is the best time to nap? Salk Institute researcher Sara Mednick generally recommends you nap approximately six to seven hours after waking . Trouble falling asleep? Write down any worries and think positive (but not exciting) thoughts. Trying too hard to sleep is counterproductive. Worried you won't wake up in time? Richard Wiseman recommends a cup of coffee immediately before napping . The caffeine will kick in 25 minutes after you lay down. Sum up We'd all be better off with 10 hours of sleep a night — but that's not going to happen for most of us. Naps can boost performance and help make up for some of the problems sleep deprivation can cause.

Drogba sealed a dramatic south west London homecoming on Friday , signing a one-year deal for the side he fired to Champions League glory in 2012. The 36-year-old netted 157 goals in 341 appearances during his eight-year initial stay at Stamford Bridge, and the frontman was named Chelsea’s greatest ever player in a poll of fans following his exit. And while Walker admits Drogba may find his playing time reduced, with £32million summer signing Diego Costa likely to be Jose Mourinho’s favoured sole striker, the ex-Blues man believes he could still have a big impact at the club this term. “Drogba was a fantastic scorer and a great talisman for the club for eight years, but I don’t think you can look back on that now, it’s a new period in his career,” he told Kick Off. “It will remain to be seen if he starts many games next season, it will all depend on the fitness of Diego Costa , Fernando Torres and possibly Romelu Lukaku as well. “But his own fitness will be a big factor. At 36, can he still produce at that level for 90 minutes? \"I think we can all agree that Drogba won’t be a starting player for Chelsea this season, but my initial feeling is, what a man to bring on with 20 minutes to go! “He will give a huge boost to the team and the fans, he’ll lift the whole of Stamford Bridge when he enters the field. “He’ll certainly still be a danger, there’s no doubt about that. If he’s in the penalty area and you put the balls in the box he will score goals. He’s still a gamechanger. “He’s got that love for the football club, which will give him a huge lift and I’m sure he can raise his game to the necessary level to play for a club like Chelsea again.”", "score"=>180.43642, "summaryTitle"=>"Exclusive – Drogba will have bit-part role for Chelsea this season, claims Walker", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Former Chelsea winger Clive Walker believes returning Blues legend Didier Drogba will have to settle for the role of ‘super-sub’ at Stamford Bridge this season.\nDrogba sealed a dramatic south west London homecoming on Friday, signing a one-year deal for the side he fired to Champions League glory in 2012.", "cities"=>["gb", "us"], "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://talksport.com/football/exclusive-drogba-will-have-bit-part-role-chelsea-season-claims-walker-140725103948", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "twitter.com", "t.co", "direct", "bit.ly"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1kfy5tr", "lastseen"=>"20140726004539", "page"=>"http://talksport.com/football/exclusive-drogba-will-have-bit-part-role-chelsea-season-claims-walker-140725103948", "ogtitle"=>"Exclusive – Drogba will have bit-part role for Chelsea this season, claims Walker"}, {"domain"=>"bostonglobe.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406290837000", "h2"=>["Sections", "Today’s Paper", "This year, Patriots’ strong suit is defense", "Experts call on judge to block Partners’ hospital takeovers", "Voers would pay for road fixes", "Arthur T.

From the characters to the setting, it is a quintessential American drama. At Market Basket, it’s been the same folks dishing out cold cuts, stocking the produce aisles, and running the checkout counters for years. Some employees met their spouses there, and children follow parents into the business. Employees identify with the company’s family culture. To customers, they’re neighbors or friends, even relatives. Moreover, Market Basket represents an increasingly rare business culture, one where workers are unusually well paid, willing to put their jobs on the line to force the reinstatement of a beloved boss who made them feel valued. All this at a time when most workers fret about job security and don’t know who owns their companies. Related Photos “We have a corporate culture in the US where most workers are living somewhere between anxiety and boredom,” said Erik Gregory, who directs the organizational and leadership psychology program at the Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology. “Demoulas has created a family environment, and they want to hold on to that. It’s important today, when a lot of companies don’t appear to have your back.” So we have the unusual scene of rank-and-file employees staging picket lines outside Market Basket stores, and urging customers to spend their money at the competition until the board of directors reverses the firing of Arthur T. Demoulas. Demoulas was forced out as president in June by members of his own feuding family, including archrival cousin Arthur S. Demoulas. The boycott has nearly paralyzed the 71-store chain, enlisting the backing of thousands of loyal customers who are passionate about Market Basket’s low prices — and willing to join he boycott if it helps the employees who oversee it all. So why, exactly, is a group of middle-class workers risking or sacrificing their livelihoods for a multimillionaire executive who will suffer no great hardship in unemployment? The most common refrain heard from employees concerns some small kindness from Arthur T. Demoulas. Steve Paulenka, one of eight managers fired for participating in the protest, talks about the interest Arthur T. Demoulas took in his autistic son, Joe, after the boy broke two front teeth and needed reconstructive surgery. For weeks after the accident, Demoulas would ask about the boy whenever he saw Paulenka. “Not, ‘Who is making payroll?’ but, ‘How’s Joe?’ ” recalled Paulenka. But there is another important factor: The pay is generous enough that managers and supervisors can easily make into the six-figures as they advance up the corporate ladder. The pay for hourly workers is hardly extravagant, but high by supermarket standards -- more than $40,000 for experienced cashiers, while full-time clerks start at $12 an hour, well above the minimum wage. Most workers can also regularly count on receiving tidy bonuses, typically doled out four times per year, that can amount to an extra six to eight weeks of pay. In the grocery industry, “typically there are no bonuses for clerks,” said Kevin Griffin, publisher of the Griffin Report of Food Marketing, a trade publication for the food industry. “Do you get a bonus every quarter? Nobody does. But at Market Basket, everybody does.” Market Basket also contributes an amount equivalent to 15 percent of each employee’s pay to a retirement plan, and some longtime workers retire with more than $1 million in savings. Solid pay. A boss who cares. It’s not exactly a magic formula. “We must ask whether the workers’ grievances are about much more than reinstating a popular CEO,” said Gary Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University. “If you peek behind the large signs and pictures of Arthur T., you might see that the underlying problem — one of workers’ resentment and insecurity [without him] — is the real issue.” Indeed, employees’ impassioned speeches exhorting Market Basket to bring back Demoulas are laced with unease about their own futures. Among the fears is that his relatives will cut wages and benefits in order to pay themselves even more or, worse, sell to some soulless chain that will turn Market Basket into just another indifferent employer. “Market Basket employees think that without Arthur T., they won’t be able to hold on to their values and will fall into a vicious cycle,” said Zeynep Ton, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who visited the picket lines this week. “I don’t blame them for fighting to keep the integrity of their business.” The company’s board, which includes representatives of the two warring factions of the Demoulas family, will meet Friday afternoon at the Prudential Center in Boston. Workers plan to present a petition with more than 40,000 signatures in support of “Artie T,” as they affectionately call him. Another large rally is scheduled for 9 a.m. in Tewksbury, where Market Basket is based. Erin Ailworth and Casey Ross of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

Last time we had environment and clarity designer Richard \"Nome\" Liu go in-depth on why Clarity is important in League of Legends. Up this week is Riot Games' Vice President of Game Design, Tom \"Zileas\" Cadwell , here to talk to one of League's most central themes: the pursuit of mastery. Zileas has been a part of Riot Games for a long time and he's actually the one who first introduced several of the terms used in our design values series – like Counterplay. Today, however, Zileas will be focusing more on mastery as it relates to every design decision we make in League and why it's so important to the game as a whole. Onward! Chris ‘Pwyff’ Tom Mastery Players are driven to play different game genres for different reasons. In MMOs, it might be a feeling of progression or social achievement. In single-player, story-focused games, it might be about immersion, or making your way through a deep narrative. In the MOBA genre, we believe the main thing that motivates players to stick around is  the pursuit of mastery. Whether you're trying to be the best League player in the world or you're just picking up on how to last hit, playing League of Legends is about continually growing and becoming a better player. We believe that players who play League are seeking mastery, and our design philosophy is deeply tied to this idea. For our part, we hope to make a player's journey endlessly rich and fulfilling; someone who adapts quickly and instinctually should be rewarded as much as the one who spends days figuring out the most optimal path forward - both are pursuing mastery in their own unique ways. We’ve identified three major areas of mastery: personal expertise , teamwork , and adaptability . Personal Expertise Personal expertise is the direct skill you bring in controlling your character to win a fight or earn gold. It’s your ability to last hit, execute a basic combo, dodge and land skill shots, or make an informed decision in a fight. Some of the ways we can support personal expertise include: Creating optimization paths for champions  is a design strategy we've spent more time on over the years. When we design or update champions, we ask if there are multiple levels of mastery possible – places where a player can fine-tune their skills to become even better over time. Yasuo and his passive, Way of the Wanderer, is a good example of growing mastery, where maximizing Flow through movement and ability use – and ensuring that large flow increases aren't 'wasted' on a full bar – can separate the good Yasuos from the great Yasuos. Rewarding consistent demonstrations of skill is an important philosophy for us, and this means smoothing out cases where this isn't true. As an example, system overhauls are large projects that try to build more potential for mastery. We continue to look at League and ask ourselves: when and where are players unable to use their skill to shine? And where these problems exist, is there a way we can fix it? Here are some examples from the 2014 pre-season changes where we made system overhauls to reward consistent skill: Reducing team snowballing allowed players to win more often via their skill than their stats. When teams snowball out of control prematurely it becomes impossible for the opposing team, even with amazing play, to recover. On the other hand, a really 'fed' single player can still be focused and killed.  Stronger support scaling allows support players to continue to show their skill into the late game, rather than being overshadowed by the rest of their team in importance. When your power level is too different from other players in the game, even highly skilled players can feel like they're not making a difference. Counterplay,  which will be further detailed by Morello in another blog, is the philosophy of designing champions to be challenging to master for both the player playing them and the opponent trying to beat them. When two champions fight, we want nuance, thought, and timing to matter in both directions, which means the best player should win. You're only as good as the opponents you can beat, and a champion that lacks counterplay is one which, if executed perfectly, leaves their opponent with shallow or nonexistent response choices. Teamwork Teamwork is the ability to read a teammate's intentions while also giving cues in turn, or the ability to stay positive when setbacks occur, or the ability to do what's best for the team at all times. We design for teamwork in two major areas: teamplay and team incentives. Teamplay  is a design philosophy similar to counterplay, and Statikk will be going more in-depth in his dev blog. In short, if a particular strategy or set of abilities become stronger with increasingly effective team coordination, teamplay is there. At a basic level, this means that we have to design in a way where your teammates need to care what you're doing, and react to it. To do this, we try to make abilities, like Thresh's Dark Passage, which greatly increase in power when the team collaborates effectively.  Team Incentives encourage players to play as a team. Basic systems like assist gold are an example of this, as are objectives like towers, dragon and baron. We've also positioned all of League of Legend’s out-of-game rewards and ranked play (wins/losses) entirely around team success in order to reward players for playing as a team. This has the final effect of helping players understand that the path to mastery must  involve the mastery of teamwork. Adaptability Adaptability is both your ability to learn and respond to new ideas, new threats and new changes, along with your ability to play in a variety of styles. Different players are adaptable in different ways. Some choose to pick up a large number of champions, while others spend that time deeply mastering one along a variety of builds. We try to support both, but fundamentally believe that to pursue mastery in League is about being an adaptable player.  Our primary method of rewarding adaptability is through  system and play balance changes . We aspire to keep as many champions as possible viable at a competitive level (to mixed success, admittedly), and also spend a lot of time trying to increase the amount of viable team-level strategies. The better balanced the game is, the more we can reward players who remain adaptable against a wide breadth of threats, and similarly reward them for investing time in learning to play less-popular champions and strategies. Closing Thoughts We're committed to continuing to improve the potential for mastery in League of Legends, and look forward also helping you understand the ways we can achieve this goal (or give us feedback if you feel we're not!). We fundamentally believe a game where you know you're getting better with effort is also a game that's rewarding to play. We also hope you'll remain committed to your own mastery – and that this blog can serve as a reminder to challenge yourself to master new skills, champions and strategies!

During one conversation, a curious Fredette asked Anderson how the power forward liked playing in the Big Easy. “He had all positives to say,” Fredette remembered of Anderson’s response. “He said, ‘I love the city. It’s great people, a great organization, the guys on the team are fun to be around and there are no egos. Everybody’s playing for the team and playing to win.’ ” When Fredette, a three-year NBA veteran, entered unrestricted free agency this summer, Anderson’s glowing report was in the back of his mind. The 25-year-old former college phenom at BYU officially signed with the New Orleans Pelicans on July 24, after splitting last season between Sacramento and Chicago. “I didn’t get to talk to Ryan during the (free agency) decision-making process, but I had talked to him a lot before that, when I was on the Kings,” Fredette said. “He really liked his experience here. That was cool for me to hear. Going into this offseason, I remembered him saying that, so that played a part into it (signing with New Orleans).” After playing less each season as his NBA career has progressed, from 1,135 minutes as a rookie to just 519 minutes in 2013-14, the 6-foot-2 guard was looking for an opportunity to be on the court more. The upstate New York native also wanted to find a team that believed he could be an important part of their plans. “A big part of it was that the organization really wanted me to be there,” Fredette said. “That’s something you’re always looking for. You want to be wanted. You want to be on a team where they think you can really help them. I really liked that about New Orleans. But I also think New Orleans has a great, young group of guys that can be very, very good this year. Last year, they were a little bit injury-plagued, but I think this year, if guys can stay healthy and things go the way that they’re planned, we could be a very good team. I’m excited about that. I wanted to be a part of it.” Fredette believes the Pelicans are also an ideal fit for his game because of the makeup of their roster, which includes several feared offensive players who can attack the basket and command attention from defenders. Fredette, a career 40.1 percent shooter from three-point range, could fill a similar floor-spacing role as Anthony Morrow, who thrived last season with the Pelicans before signing with Oklahoma City as a free agent. “I had definitely looked into that,” Fredette said, when asked about the Morrow comparison. “Obviously when he and Brian Roberts left (to sign with Charlotte), a couple spots opened up here. I think that I can provide that type of shooting from the bench. I think that’s what the team was kind of looking for and that’s why they were interested in me. They thought I could be a great part of this team. So I realized that and thought it was a great opportunity for me, and hopefully the organization.” Fredette has played eight career games vs. New Orleans, shooting 47.4 percent from three-point range. He monitored the Pelicans from afar last season, taking note of their talented and youthful core. He believed they had potential to be a dangerous team entering 2013-14, but injuries prevented the Pelicans from contending for a playoff berth. “Anthony Davis obviously is a great player who was an All-Star last year,” Fredette said. “Jrue Holiday two years ago was an All-Star. So they have a great, young group of guys. Tyreke Evans, who I played with in Sacramento for two years, was Rookie of the Year. Eric Gordon is a great scorer. They have a lot of guys that can really play and are young and coming up together. So I’m excited about this team. I think I fit in really well, being able to create space for these guys and knock down shots and score the basketball when I have that opportunity. I think it fits really well.” The departures of Morrow and Roberts left openings in the Pelicans’ backcourt rotation that Fredette could partly fill. He’s rotated between point guard and shooting guard as a pro; he believes he’ll continue to do so with his new team. “Coach (Monty) Williams said that he sees me as a ‘scoring guard,’ on-ball or off the ball,” Fredette said. “I’m sure I’ll play both (positions) at different times. That’s kind of the way it’s been for my career. I feel comfortable at both spots. So whatever can get me on the floor the most, that’s what I’m willing to do. He sees me as a scoring guard, being able to come in and help the team, score the basketball and make plays for myself, but also for teammates. That’s kind of how they see me. That’s how I see myself, as a guy who can supply offense and help the team.”", "score"=>180.01112, "summaryTitle"=>"‘Scoring guard’ Jimmer Fredette sees Pelicans as ideal fit", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Ryan Anderson and Jimmer Fredette share the same agent and have become friends, so it wasn’t uncommon for the two to grab dinner in New Orleans whenever Fredette’s Sacramento Kings visited the Crescent City.

The practice, known as cell phone unlocking, is illegal. It probably won't surprise you that in the '90s, wireless carriers—who, for obvious reasons, wanted everyone to buy new phones and plans—lobbied for a ban. As I wrote last year, this ban isn't just annoying and expensive for consumers, it's also wasteful. We only keep our phones for an average of 18 months , and when we get a new one, the old one seldom makes it to a recycling facility. Many languish in desk drawers; some end up in the garbage. That means a lot of electronic waste in landfills, not to mention the environmentally hazardous materials such as rare earths required to make all those new phones. So it's great news that today the House unanimously passed a law that would finally make phone unlocking legal. The Senate approved the measure last week. Now President Obama just needs to sign off, which he has pledged to do.

Distractions are plentiful when you are home, and often it’s only the most disciplined who can remain productive", "content"=>"July 25, 2014 Working from home can be convenient to employees and help companies save money, but it’s not the right fit for every worker. Distractions are plentiful when you are home, and often it’s only the most disciplined who can remain productive and efficient. “Working from home should be considered dangerous and could be a disaster when you consider the potential impact on your quality of life,” warns Grant Cardone, author of If You're Not First, You're Last . “The level of discipline it takes to work from home and generate solid results is intense and most people fail at home because of this one fact.” If your idea of working from home involves wearing pajamas and juggling personal and work responsibilities at the same time, it’s time to reshape your priorities. Follow these five tips to effectively manage work and life as a remote worker. 1. Have a Separate Office Space Just because you don’t have to go into an office and sit behind a desk everyday doesn’t mean you can stay in bed or in front of the TV with your laptop trying to complete your work. Career experts recommend setting up a specific office area in the home so you can “go to work” and not be distracted by dirty dishes, a crying child or a favorite TV show. “Where your workspace is makes a big difference,” says Sara Sutton Fell, CEO of FlexJobs and a at-home worker for nearly 10 years. “When my second son was born, I realized it was really important for me to get more separation, so I moved my office to a space above our detached garage rather than in the house.” Related: 5 Things to Know Before Hiring Freelancers 2. Set Clear Boundaries Having a dedicated work space is half the battle, but you also need to set rules about who and what can enter your office. “Create very strict boundaries where there are no dogs, kids or spouses allowed,” says Cardone. “The door needs to remain shut with only those that have top clearance allowed access.” The work space should also be void of distractions. For instance, forgo putting a TV in your office or checking Facebook five times a day. 3. Keep Regular Work Hours and Prepare Maintaining normal office hours can help maintain productivity. According to Joel Garfinkle, author of Getting Ahead: Three Steps to Take Your Career to the Next Level, not only should you strictly abide by your work hours, you should make sure your family and friends also respect the rules.   “Your family and friends need to pretend you simply aren't there, unless it's a dire emergency,” says Garfinkle. “Remind your family of these hours and let them know you expect them to respect your work time so that you won’t have to work when you should be spending with them.”   In addition to setting the hours, career experts say it’s a good idea not to work all day in your pajamas. Keep your normal preparation routine, take a shower and get dressed, even if your commute is just down the hall.   “People brag about working from home in their underwear, but that  is no way to grow a successful business,” says Cardone. “Have a set time, wake up, shower, and get dressed just as you would if you were commuting to a professional office space and you will be more productive.”    Related: Is Your Business Out of Control? Take This Quiz to Find Out 4. Change Your Mindset Avoiding a long commute and having more flexibility over your schedule are enticing results of working from home, but there’s more to it than these perks. “The main motivation of convenience or comfort, which most people who work from home have, is flawed,” says Cardone. Yes, it’s more convenient to not have to go to an office every day, but remote workers can’t view it as an excuse to slack off. While self-starters are better suited for working at home, according to Sutton Fell, she says being a proactive communicator is the “secret weapon” to being successful. “By taking initiative to communicate, you have a motivated and leading role in the connection with your colleagues’ activities and keeping them abreast of what you’re achieving and keeping on the pulse on everyone’s expectations.” 5. Know When to Throw in the Towel If your productivity is declining or it’s difficult to balance work and life, then it may be time to re-evaluate your work situation. Perhaps you need more interaction with co-workers or bosses or maybe being at home is too distracting, but it’s important to be honest, says Garfinkle.   “It’s OK that you’re not well-suited for working from home,” says Garfinkle. “There’s nothing wrong with that.” Related: The Irony of Successful Sales Growth   This story originally appeared on FOX BUSINESS", "score"=>179.27885, "summaryTitle"=>"How to Stay Productive Working From Home", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Distractions are plentiful when you are home, and often it’s only the most disciplined who can remain productive and efficient.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://smallbusiness.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/08/29/how-to-stay-productive-working-from-home/", "referrer"=>["entm.ag", "direct", "t.co", "lnkd.in", "facebook.com", "linkedin.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1tH3ipz", "lastseen"=>"20140726004348", "page"=>"http://smallbusiness.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2013/08/29/how-to-stay-productive-working-from-home/", "ogtitle"=>"How to Stay Productive Working From Home"}, {"domain"=>"giants.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406329225000", "h2"=>["Players who stood out at practice (7/25)", "TRENDING NOW", "Latest News", "LATEST VIDEOS", "FEATURED PHOTO GALLERY"], "h3"=>["Giants.com's Dan Salomone names these three players as having standout practices!", "The Story: Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie's superhero cleats", "Five things we learned at practice (7/25)", "Players who stood out at practice (7/25)", "LB Jon Beason confident in return for season opener", "The Story: Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie's superhero cleats", "Five things we learned at practice (7/25)", "Players who stood out at practice (7/25)", "LB Jon Beason confident in return for season opener", "RB David Wilson makes contact; practice notes", "Giants Training Camp LIVE", "BBI Trophy Presentation: Antrel Rolle Speech", "MUST WATCH: Big hit by Rookie Devon Kennard", "Coach Flaherty talks about improving the O-line", "Coach Nunn talks about the health of the d-line", "Photos from #GiantsCamp (7/25)"], "site"=>"www.giants.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004723", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335643447", "title"=>"Players who stood out at practice (7/25)", "initial"=>"20140725230025", "summaryText"=>"WR Corey Washington One of the defensive co-captains last year, Antrel Rolle hasn’t shied away from talking about how talented the Giants are as a whole, specifically in the secondary.

The 6-2, 208-pound wide receiver created enough separation for himself to give Eli Manning enough of a window to connect on two outstanding plays. The first was a great twisting catch from Randle down the right sideline, which was followed up by Manning squeezing one through traffic to his third-year target later in practice. Just yesterday Randle was talking about the necessity to create space in the Giants’ new offense, which emphasizes yards after the catch. CB Charles James/LB Mark Herzlich It took until late in the day for the defense to notch an interception. That’s when cornerback Charles James and linebacker Mark Herzlich each grabbed one in the span of just a few reps. James went first and elevated to pick off a deep pass from Ryan Nassib .

Your time with the local Boys and Girls Club is covered under Volunteer Experience & Causes and you’re feeling like a LinkedIn pro. When I joined LinkedIn more than a year ago, I fancied myself a LinkedIn expert.  I’d checked all the boxes, shared content with my network and made sure my profile was always a true representation of where I was in my professional journey. What I’ve since learned is that as we as professionals grow and evolve, so do the ways we need to think about and express our achievements and aspirations so that we can be found and recognized for the things that matter most to us. Over the past year, our team has been working hard to expand the profile experience – exploring and introducing new tools to help you manage and build your professional identity to help ensure the right people and opportunities are finding you. The result? The LinkedIn Profile has become a treasure chest of options and controls – just waiting for you to explore them. As someone who is now responsible for leading the teams responsible for dreaming up and designing key elements of LinkedIn Profile experience, I’ve developed a few favorite insider tips to help members like yourself take your profile and professional brand on LinkedIn to the next level: Be a thought leader   LinkedIn is opening up its publishing platform to all members so that you can publish long-form posts about professional topics that matter to you. This is your chance to position yourself as a thought leader – let people in on how you think and what you think about. Not only will you drive more professionals to your profile , but these posts become part of your professional story when they visit your profile. If this tool isn’t available to you yet, no worries, just request it here . Show off your best assets Endorsements have been one of the fastest growing and most widely adopted features across LinkedIn. Earlier this year we introduced new levels of controls to help you engage and manage skills and endorsements in a way that works for you. Select “edit” next to skills and endorsements and you’ll see you now have the ability to re-order your skills, moving those that matter most to you to the top of the pile. New levels of controls also make it possible for you to decide how involved you want to be in the LinkedIn endorsements ecosystem – from all in, to all out — or somewhere in between. Raise a hand to do-goodery Making sure you’ve added recent volunteer experience is the first step, but did you know that you can also send a signal to nonprofit organizations to let them know you’re interested in volunteering or joining a nonprofit board? From the edit experience under the volunteer and causes section – simply select one or both of the boxes offered to join a nonprofit board or participate in skills based volunteering. Checking these boxes makes it possible for those looking for people like you, to find you faster than ever. Broadcast loud and proud or keep it on the down low Maybe you’re adding an example of a recently successful launch, or new volunteer experience. Perhaps you’ve recently become accredited or received a certification in an online course – or maybe you’re just giving your profile a scrub as you consider new employment opportunities. Now you can determine, each time you edit your profile, whether it’s something you want to share with your network or not.  Trying to keep a lower profile? No problem. As you’re editing, simply look for the white box that says “Notify your network?” and select either “Yes, publish changes” or “No, do not publish changes” before saving changes you’ve made. No more trying to remember what your original settings are, you can now make the choice in the moment to broadcast loudly, or keep things on the down low. Put your best professional foot forward Every now and then we all have the desire to mix things up a little – but we can struggle to know where to begin. Wondering what you can do to kick your LinkedIn Profile up a notch? From your profile select the box marked “Complete your profile” to the right of your profile photo. This guided editing experience will help you make sure you’ve covered all your bases while offering some inspiration on where to start and what to say as you go. Know what your connections are up to If you asked just about anyone that works at LinkedIn what their favorite best kept secret is — my guess is a majority would point to the ability to see the recent activity of your connections, directly on their profile.  This tool comes in handy before jumping into a meeting, onto a call or heading out to catch up with an old acquaintance. One click and you can see what they’ve recently shared, written or engaged with across LinkedIn. To access this, simply look for the small triangle drop-down icon next to “endorse” and select “View Recent Activity”. These are just a few of my favorite tips. Give them a shot and take your LinkedIn expertise to all new levels. Have favorite tips of your own? A profile you’re particularly proud of or a LinkedIn story to share?

Don Miller has also talked recently about completing things. It’s tougher than it looks, right? I can tell you where my difficulty comes from. I’ve been in the publishing industry practically my whole professional life. And if there’s one thing that defines the business, it’s the slow, methodical process of taking an idea to market. Not only does an author’s writing process consume a lot of time, but the editorial, design, and production processes also slog along. The Perfection Trap The reason makes more sense than frustrated authors and readers might think at first. The truth is it takes considerable coordination to get it all right. Everyone’s in the kitchen: editors, proofers, designers, printers, marketers, publicists, and salespeople. Once you print something, it’s as good as in stone. Any error or mistake could live for more than a century. And until recently the practice was to print a massive quantity of a new title. So our biggest fear was producing a book that was both wrong and plentiful. All that to say, I was trained in an industry that was slow on purpose. But that doesn’t work for me now—any more than it works well for traditional publishers in the new digital world. When you sit on something until it’s “perfect,” you miss a lot of opportunities. When you sit on something until it’s “perfect,” you miss a lot of opportunities. Michael Hyatt Maybe you’re not from the publishing world, but there’s a good chance you still suffer from some version of the Perfection Trap. Thankfully, I finally found my way out. A Whole New Freedom What helped me was to think of my work like software. When I started doing that, it was like the shackles came off and the iron door inside opened up. Here’s how it works. All software contains bugs, but, as those imperfections are reported, developers correct them and issue updates. Users expect this cycle as a normal part of the process. In fact, the more successful and useful the software is, the more likely it is to go through numerous iterations. The best programs are practically in a state of permanent beta. When I started thinking along those lines I was finally freed to finish. My projects didn’t have to be perfect. They just had to be good and useful today. I could always update it tomorrow. What’s useless, however, is an idea that never gets off my hard drive. Last fall, I was brainstorming a goal-setting program: 5 Days to Your Best Year Ever . And I knew it had to launch at New Years. The trouble was that New Years was literally just weeks away. I’d already given up starting when my daughter Megan and friend Stu challenged me. “If you can create the content,” they said, “we can get it filmed and launched on time.” We worked like crazy from the second we decided to move, but we got it launched on time, and it has helped a lot of people. I hear from them all the time. Was it perfect? No, but here’s what’s liberating: I have the opportunity to improve it! In fact, I just did. We recently finished filming a new version for next year, and it’s full of new and helpful ideas for getting what you really want out of your goals. Three Ways to Escape the Perfection Trap This new approach keeps me out of the Perfection Trap. And it lets me be more productive as a result. Earlier this month, for instance, I spoke at the World Domination Summit . I put everything I had into my presentation when I gave it. Though I received a standing ovation, I knew it could have been better. And it will be. I have another opportunity to give the same speech this fall, and I’m totally energized now to revise and improve it. Here are three ways you can adopt this new paradigm and break free from the Perfection Trap: Change your perspective. We need to reframe the way we approach our projects. Almost nothing is permanent; why would we think our projects are? In a world where things change as often as they do, it’s a strategic advantage to adapt and update a project as needed. This is especially true in information products. But it’s true for other projects too, even art. Finishing means you’re free to add value with a new project sooner. Narrow your focus. Perfect is the enemy of the good, but so is distraction. If you have too many irons in the fire, you’ll get burned out. It’s better to focus on what matters now and see it through. Then you can turn to the next thing. A lot of time when something’s not perfect, we put it aside and work on something else. But we lose focus, and when we try to do too much our quality suffers along with our output. It may not be grammatically correct, but good is better than best, especially if we’re trying to do too much. Don’t confuse perfection with excellence. Anyone who knows me knows that excellence is a high value for me. But it’s not the same thing as perfection. Perfection doesn’t take into consideration of the cost, time, or significance of something. It’s just an illusive, unreal, unattainable goal. It’s better to do good work really well. That way you’re contributing to people’s lives, instead of locked in your own head about whether your work measures up an impossible standard. Stop asking, “Is it perfect?” and start asking, “Will it move the needle in people’s lives?” Michael Hyatt We need to stop asking ourselves, “Is it perfect?” and start asking ourselves, “Will it move the needle in people’s lives?” If yes, then let’s wrap it up and ship it out.

Although we have a", "content"=>"Associated Press/Marty Reichenthal As  a psychiatrist  and neuroscientist who studies creativity, I’ve had the pleasure of working with many gifted and high-profile subjects over the years, but Kurt Vonnegut—dear, funny, eccentric, lovable, tormented Kurt Vonnegut—will always be one of my favorites. Kurt was a faculty member at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop in the 1960s, and participated in the first big study I did as a member of the university’s psychiatry department. I was examining the anecdotal link between creativity and mental illness, and Kurt was an excellent case study. He was intermittently depressed, but that was only the beginning. His mother had suffered from depression and committed suicide on Mother’s Day, when Kurt was 21 and home on military leave during World War II. His son, Mark, was originally diagnosed with schizophrenia but may actually have bipolar disorder. (Mark, who is a practicing physician, recounts his experiences in two books,  The Eden Express  and  Just Like Someone Without Mental Illness Only More So , in which he reveals that many family members struggled with psychiatric problems. “My mother, my cousins, and my sisters weren’t doing so great,” he writes. “We had eating disorders, co-dependency, outstanding warrants, drug and alcohol problems, dating and employment problems, and other ‘issues.’ ”)  While mental illness clearly runs in the Vonnegut family, so, I found, does creativity. Kurt’s father was a gifted architect, and his older brother Bernard was a talented physical chemist and inventor who possessed 28 patents. Mark is a writer, and both of Kurt’s daughters are visual artists. Kurt’s work, of course, needs no introduction. For many of my subjects from that first study—all writers associated with the Iowa Writers’ Workshop—mental illness and creativity went hand in hand. This link is not surprising. The archetype of the mad genius dates back to at least classical times, when Aristotle noted, “Those who have been eminent in philosophy, politics, poetry, and the arts have all had tendencies toward melancholia.” This pattern is a recurring theme in Shakespeare’s plays, such as when Theseus, in  A Midsummer Night’s Dream , observes, “The lunatic, the lover, and the poet / Are of imagination all compact.” John Dryden made a similar point in a heroic couplet: “Great wits are sure to madness near allied, / And thin partitions do their bounds divide.” Compared with many of history’s creative luminaries, Vonnegut, who died of natural causes, got off relatively easy. Among those who ended up losing their battles with mental illness through suicide are Virginia Woolf, Ernest Hemingway, Vincent van Gogh, John Berryman, Hart Crane, Mark Rothko, Diane Arbus, Anne Sexton, and Arshile Gorky. My interest in this pattern is rooted in my dual identities as a scientist and a literary scholar. In an early parallel with Sylvia Plath, a writer I admired, I studied literature at Radcliffe and then went to Oxford on a Fulbright scholarship; she studied literature at Smith and attended Cambridge on a Fulbright. Then our paths diverged, and she joined the tragic list above. My curiosity about our different outcomes has shaped my career. I earned a doctorate in literature in 1963 and joined the faculty of the University of Iowa to teach Renaissance literature. At the time, I was the first woman the university’s English department had ever hired into a tenure-track position, and so I was careful to publish under the gender-neutral name of N. J. C. Andreasen. Not long after this, a book I’d written about the poet John Donne was accepted for publication by Princeton University Press. Instead of feeling elated, I felt almost ashamed and self-indulgent. Who would this book help? What if I channeled the effort and energy I’d invested in it into a career that might save people’s lives? Within a month, I made the decision to become a research scientist, perhaps a medical doctor. I entered the University of Iowa’s medical school, in a class that included only five other women, and began working with patients suffering from schizophrenia and mood disorders. I was drawn to psychiatry because at its core is the most interesting and complex organ in the human body: the brain. I have spent much of my career focusing on the neuroscience of mental illness, but in recent decades I’ve also focused on what we might call the science of genius, trying to discern what combination of elements tends to produce particularly creative brains. What, in short, is the essence of creativity? Over the course of my life, I’ve kept coming back to two more-specific questions: What differences in nature and nurture can explain why some people suffer from mental illness and some do not? And why are so many of the world’s most creative minds among the most afflicted? My latest study, for which I’ve been scanning the brains of some of today’s most illustrious scientists, mathematicians, artists, and writers, has come closer to answering this second question than any other research to date. The first attempted  examinations  of the connection between genius and insanity were largely anecdotal. In his 1891 book,  The Man of Genius , Cesare Lombroso, an Italian physician, provided a gossipy and expansive account of traits associated with genius—left-handedness, celibacy, stammering, precocity, and, of course, neurosis and psychosis—and he linked them to many creative individuals, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Sir Isaac Newton, Arthur Schopenhauer, Jonathan Swift, Charles Darwin, Lord Byron, Charles Baudelaire, and Robert Schumann. Lombroso speculated on various causes of lunacy and genius, ranging from heredity to urbanization to climate to the phases of the moon. He proposed a close association between genius and degeneracy and argued that both are hereditary. Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, took a much more rigorous approach to the topic. In his 1869 book,  Hereditary Genius , Galton used careful documentation—including detailed family trees showing the more than 20 eminent musicians among the Bachs, the three eminent writers among the Brontës, and so on—to demonstrate that genius appears to have a strong genetic component. He was also the first to explore in depth the relative contributions of nature and nurture to the development of genius. As research methodology improved over time, the idea that genius might be hereditary gained support. For his 1904  Study of British Genius , the English physician Havelock Ellis twice reviewed the 66 volumes of  The Dictionary of National Biography . In his first review, he identified individuals whose entries were three pages or longer. In his second review, he eliminated those who “displayed no high intellectual ability” and added those who had shorter entries but showed evidence of “intellectual ability of high order.” His final list consisted of 1,030 individuals, only 55 of whom were women. Much like Lombroso, he examined how heredity, general health, social class, and other factors may have contributed to his subjects’ intellectual distinction. Although Ellis’s approach was resourceful, his sample was limited, in that the subjects were relatively famous but not necessarily highly creative. He found that 8.2 percent of his overall sample of 1,030 suffered from melancholy and 4.2 percent from insanity. Because he was relying on historical data provided by the authors of  The Dictionary of National Biography  rather than direct contact, his numbers likely underestimated the prevalence of mental illness in his sample. A more empirical approach can be found in the early-20th-century work of Lewis M. Terman, a Stanford psychologist whose multivolume  Genetic Studies of Genius  is one of the most legendary studies in American psychology. He used a longitudinal design—meaning he studied his subjects repeatedly over time—which was novel then, and the project eventually became the longest-running longitudinal study in the world. Terman himself had been a gifted child, and his interest in the study of genius derived from personal experience. (Within six months of starting school, at age 5, Terman was advanced to third grade—which was not seen at the time as a good thing; the prevailing belief was that precocity was abnormal and would produce problems in adulthood.) Terman also hoped to improve the measurement of “genius” and test Lombroso’s suggestion that it was associated with degeneracy. In 1916, as a member of the psychology department at Stanford, Terman developed America’s first IQ test, drawing from a version developed by the French psychologist Alfred Binet. This test, known as the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, contributed to the development of the Army Alpha, an exam the American military used during World War I to screen recruits and evaluate them for work assignments and determine whether they were worthy of officer status. Terman eventually used the Stanford-Binet test to select high-IQ students for his longitudinal study, which began in 1921. His long-term goal was to recruit at least 1,000 students from grades three through eight who represented the smartest 1 percent of the urban California population in that age group. The subjects had to have an IQ greater than 135, as measured by the Stanford-Binet test. The recruitment process was intensive: students were first nominated by teachers, then given group tests, and finally subjected to individual Stanford-Binet tests. After various enrichments—adding some of the subjects’ siblings, for example—the final sample consisted of 856 boys and 672 girls. One finding that emerged quickly was that being the youngest student in a grade was an excellent predictor of having a high IQ. (This is worth bearing in mind today, when parents sometimes choose to hold back their children precisely so they will not be the youngest in their grades.) These children were initially evaluated in all sorts of ways. Researchers took their early developmental histories, documented their play interests, administered medical examinations—including 37 different anthropometric measurements—and recorded how many books they’d read during the past two months, as well as the number of books available in their homes (the latter number ranged from zero to 6,000, with a mean of 328). These gifted children were then reevaluated at regular intervals throughout their lives. “The Termites,” as Terman’s subjects have come to be known, have debunked some stereotypes and introduced new paradoxes. For example, they were generally physically superior to a comparison group—taller, healthier, more athletic. Myopia (no surprise) was the only physical deficit. They were also more socially mature and generally better adjusted. And these positive patterns persisted as the children grew into adulthood. They tended to have happy marriages and high salaries. So much for the concept of “early ripe and early rotten,” a common assumption when Terman was growing up. But despite the implications of the title  Genetic Studies of Genius , the Termites’ high IQs did not predict high levels of creative achievement later in life. Only a few made significant creative contributions to society; none appear to have demonstrated extremely high creativity levels of the sort recognized by major awards, such as the Nobel Prize. (Interestingly, William Shockley, who was a 12-year-old Palo Alto resident in 1922, somehow failed to make the cut for the study, even though he would go on to share a Nobel Prize in physics for the invention of the transistor.) Thirty percent of the men and 33 percent of the women did not even graduate from college. A surprising number of subjects pursued humble occupations, such as semiskilled trades or clerical positions. As the study evolved over the years, the term  gifted  was substituted for  genius . Although many people continue to equate intelligence with genius, a crucial conclusion from Terman’s study is that having a high IQ is not equivalent to being highly creative. Subsequent studies by other researchers have reinforced Terman’s conclusions, leading to what’s known as the threshold theory, which holds that above a certain level, intelligence doesn’t have much effect on creativity: most creative people are pretty smart, but they don’t have to be  that  smart, at least as measured by conventional intelligence tests. An IQ of 120, indicating that someone is very smart but not exceptionally so, is generally considered sufficient for creative genius. But if high IQ  does not indicate creative genius, then what does? And how can one identify creative people for a study? One approach, which is sometimes referred to as the study of “little  c ,” is to develop quantitative assessments of creativity—a necessarily controversial task, given that it requires settling on what creativity actually is. The basic concept that has been used in the development of these tests is skill in “divergent thinking,” or the ability to come up with many responses to carefully selected questions or probes, as contrasted with “convergent thinking,” or the ability to come up with the correct answer to problems that have only one answer. For example, subjects might be asked, “How many uses can you think of for a brick?” A person skilled in divergent thinking might come up with many varied responses, such as building a wall; edging a garden; and serving as a bludgeoning weapon, a makeshift shot put, a bookend. Like IQ tests, these exams can be administered to large groups of people. Assuming that creativity is a trait everyone has in varying amounts, those with the highest scores can be classified as exceptionally creative and selected for further study. While this approach is quantitative and relatively objective, its weakness is that certain assumptions must be accepted: that divergent thinking is the essence of creativity, that creativity can be measured using tests, and that high-scoring individuals are highly creative people. One might argue that some of humanity’s most creative achievements have been the result of convergent thinking—a process that led to Newton’s recognition of the physical formulae underlying gravity, and Einstein’s recognition that E=mc2. A second approach to defining creativity is the “duck test”: if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck. This approach usually involves selecting a group of people—writers, visual artists, musicians, inventors, business innovators, scientists—who have been recognized for some kind of creative achievement, usually through the awarding of major prizes (the Nobel, the Pulitzer, and so forth). Because this approach focuses on people whose widely recognized creativity sets them apart from the general population, it is sometimes referred to as the study of “big  C .” The problem with this approach is its inherent subjectivity. What does it mean, for example, to have “created” something? Can creativity in the arts be equated with creativity in the sciences or in business, or should such groups be studied separately? For that matter, should science or business innovation be considered creative at all? Although I recognize and respect the value of studying “little  c ,” I am an unashamed advocate of studying “big  C .” I first used this approach in the mid-1970s and 1980s, when I conducted one of the first empirical studies of creativity and mental illness. Not long after I joined the psychiatry faculty of the Iowa College of Medicine, I ran into the chair of the department, a biologically oriented psychiatrist known for his salty language and male chauvinism. “Andreasen,” he told me, “you may be an M.D./Ph.D., but that Ph.D. of yours isn’t worth sh--, and it won’t count favorably toward your promotion.” I was proud of my literary background and believed that it made me a better clinician and a better scientist, so I decided to prove him wrong by using my background as an entry point to a scientific study of genius and insanity. The University of Iowa is home to the Writers’ Workshop, the oldest and most famous creative-writing program in the United States ( UNESCO  has designated Iowa City as one of its seven “Cities of Literature,” along with the likes of Dublin and Edinburgh). Thanks to my time in the university’s English department, I was able to recruit study subjects from the workshop’s ranks of distinguished permanent and visiting faculty. Over the course of 15 years, I studied not only Kurt Vonnegut but Richard Yates, John Cheever, and 27 other well-known writers. Going into the study, I keyed my hypotheses off the litany of famous people who I knew had personal or family histories of mental illness. James Joyce, for example, had a daughter who suffered from schizophrenia, and he himself had traits that placed him on the schizophrenia spectrum. (He was socially aloof and even cruel to those close to him, and his writing became progressively more detached from his audience and from reality, culminating in the near-psychotic neologisms and loose associations of Finnegans Wake .) Bertrand Russell, a philosopher whose work I admired, had multiple family members who suffered from schizophrenia. Einstein had a son with schizophrenia, and he himself displayed some of the social and interpersonal ineptitudes that can characterize the illness. Based on these clues, I hypothesized that my subjects would have an increased rate of schizophrenia in family members but that they themselves would be relatively well. I also hypothesized that creativity might run in families, based on prevailing views that the tendencies toward psychosis and toward having creative and original ideas were closely linked. I began by designing a standard interview for my subjects, covering topics such as developmental, social, family, and psychiatric history, and work habits and approach to writing. Drawing on creativity studies done by the psychiatric epidemiologist Thomas McNeil, I evaluated creativity in family members by assigning those who had had very successful creative careers an A++ rating and those who had pursued creative interests or hobbies an A+. My final challenge was selecting a control group. After entertaining the possibility of choosing a homogeneous group whose work is not usually considered creative, such as lawyers, I decided that it would be best to examine a more varied group of people from a mixture of professions, such as administrators, accountants, and social workers. I matched this control group with the writers according to age and educational level. By matching based on education, I hoped to match for IQ, which worked out well; both the test and the control groups had an average IQ of about 120. These results confirmed Terman’s findings that creative genius is not the same as high IQ. If having a very high IQ was not what made these writers creative, then what was? As I began interviewing my subjects, I soon realized that I would not be confirming my schizophrenia hypothesis. If I had paid more attention to Sylvia Plath and Robert Lowell, who both suffered from what we today call mood disorder, and less to James Joyce and Bertrand Russell, I might have foreseen this. One after another, my writer subjects came to my office and spent three or four hours pouring out the stories of their struggles with mood disorder—mostly depression, but occasionally bipolar disorder. A full 80 percent of them had had some kind of mood disturbance at some time in their lives, compared with just 30 percent of the control group—only slightly less than an age-matched group in the general population. (At first I had been surprised that nearly all the writers I approached would so eagerly agree to participate in a study with a young and unknown assistant professor—but I quickly came to understand why they were so interested in talking to a psychiatrist.) The Vonneguts turned out to be representative of the writers’ families, in which both mood disorder and creativity were overrepresented—as with the Vonneguts, some of the creative relatives were writers, but others were dancers, visual artists, chemists, architects, or mathematicians. This is consistent with what some other studies have found. When the psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison looked at 47 famous writers and artists in Great Britain, she found that more than 38 percent had been treated for a mood disorder; the highest rates occurred among playwrights, and the second-highest among poets. When Joseph Schildkraut, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School, studied a group of 15 abstract-expressionist painters in the mid-20th century, he found that half of them had some form of mental illness, mostly depression or bipolar disorder; nearly half of these artists failed to live past age 60. While my workshop  study  answered some questions, it raised others. Why does creativity run in families? What is it that gets transmitted? How much is due to nature and how much to nurture? Are writers especially prone to mood disorders because writing is an inherently lonely and introspective activity? What would I find if I studied a group of scientists instead? These questions percolated in my mind in the weeks, months, and eventually years after the study. As I focused my research on the neurobiology of severe mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and mood disorders, studying the nature of creativity—important as the topic was and is—seemed less pressing than searching for ways to alleviate the suffering of patients stricken with these dreadful and potentially lethal brain disorders. During the 1980s, new neuroimaging techniques gave researchers the ability to study patients’ brains directly, an approach I began using to answer questions about how and why the structure and functional activity of the brain is disrupted in some people with serious mental illnesses. As I spent more time with neuroimaging technology, I couldn’t help but wonder what we would find if we used it to look inside the heads of highly creative people. Would we see a little genie that doesn’t exist inside other people’s heads? Today’s neuroimaging tools show brain structure with a precision approximating that of the examination of post-mortem tissue; this allows researchers to study all sorts of connections between brain measurements and personal characteristics. For example, we know that London taxi drivers, who must memorize maps of the city to earn a hackney’s license, have an enlarged hippocampus—a key memory region—as demonstrated in a magnetic-resonance-imaging, or MRI, study. (They know it, too: on a recent trip to London, I was proudly regaled with this information by several different taxi drivers.) Imaging studies of symphony-orchestra musicians have found them to possess an unusually large Broca’s area—a part of the brain in the left hemisphere that is associated with language—along with other discrepancies. Using another technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we can watch how the brain behaves when engaged in thought. Designing neuroimaging studies, however, is exceedingly tricky. Capturing human mental processes can be like capturing quicksilver. The brain has as many neurons as there are stars in the Milky Way, each connected to other neurons by billions of spines, which contain synapses that change continuously depending on what the neurons have recently learned. Capturing brain activity using imaging technology inevitably leads to oversimplifications, as sometimes evidenced by news reports that an investigator has found the location of something—love, guilt, decision making—in a single region of the brain. And what are we even looking for when we search for evidence of “creativity” in the brain? Although we have a definition of creativity that many people accept—the ability to produce something that is novel or original and useful or adaptive—achieving that “something” is part of a complex process, one often depicted as an “aha” or “eureka” experience. This narrative is appealing—for example, “Newton developed the concept of gravity around 1666, when an apple fell on his head while he was meditating under an apple tree.” The truth is that by 1666, Newton had already spent many years teaching himself the mathematics of his time (Euclidean geometry, algebra, Cartesian coordinates) and inventing calculus so that he could measure planetary orbits and the area under a curve. He continued to work on his theory of gravity over the subsequent years, completing the effort only in 1687, when he published  Philosophiœ Naturalis Principia Mathematica . In other words, Newton’s formulation of the concept of gravity took more than 20 years and included multiple components: preparation, incubation, inspiration—a version of the eureka experience—and production. Many forms of creativity, from writing a novel to discovering the structure of DNA, require this kind of ongoing, iterative process. With functional magnetic resonance imaging, the best we can do is capture brain activity during brief moments in time while subjects are performing some task. For instance, observing brain activity while test subjects look at photographs of their relatives can help answer the question of which parts of the brain people use when they recognize familiar faces. Creativity, of course, cannot be distilled into a single mental process, and it cannot be captured in a snapshot—nor can people produce a creative insight or thought on demand. I spent many years thinking about how to design an imaging study that could identify the unique features of the creative brain. Most of the  human brain’s  high-level functions arise from the six layers of nerve cells and their dendrites embedded in its enormous surface area, called the cerebral cortex, which is compressed to a size small enough to be carried around on our shoulders through a process known as gyrification—essentially, producing lots of folds. Some regions of the brain are highly specialized, receiving sensory information from our eyes, ears, skin, mouth, or nose, or controlling our movements. We call these regions the primary visual, auditory, sensory, and motor cortices. They collect information from the world around us and execute our actions. But we would be helpless, and effectively nonhuman, if our brains consisted only of these regions. In fact, the most extensively developed regions in the human brain are known as association cortices. These regions help us interpret and make use of the specialized information collected by the primary visual, auditory, sensory, and motor regions. For example, as you read these words on a page or a screen, they register as black lines on a white background in your primary visual cortex. If the process stopped at that point, you wouldn’t be reading at all. To read, your brain, through miraculously complex processes that scientists are still figuring out, needs to forward those black letters on to association-cortex regions such as the angular gyrus, so that meaning is attached to them; and then on to language-association regions in the temporal lobes, so that the words are connected not only to one another but also to their associated memories and given richer meanings. These associated memories and meanings constitute a “verbal lexicon,” which can be accessed for reading, speaking, listening, and writing. Each person’s lexicon is a bit different, even if the words themselves are the same, because each person has different associated memories and meanings. One difference between a great writer like Shakespeare and, say, the typical stockbroker is the size and richness of the verbal lexicon in his or her temporal association cortices, as well as the complexity of the cortices’ connections with other association regions in the frontal and parietal lobes. A neuroimaging study I conducted in 1995 using positron-emission tomography, or  PET,  scanning turned out to be unexpectedly useful in advancing my own understanding of association cortices and their role in the creative process. This  PET  study was designed to examine the brain’s different memory systems, which the great Canadian psychologist Endel Tulving identified. One system, episodic memory, is autobiographical—it consists of information linked to an individual’s personal experiences. It is called “episodic” because it consists of time-linked sequential information, such as the events that occurred on a person’s wedding day. My team and I compared this with another system, that of semantic memory, which is a repository of general information and is not personal or time-linked. In this study, we divided episodic memory into two subtypes. We examined focused  episodic memory by asking subjects to recall a specific event that had occurred in the past and to describe it with their eyes closed. And we examined a condition that we called  random  episodic silent thought, or REST : we asked subjects to lie quietly with their eyes closed, to relax, and to think about whatever came to mind. In essence, they would be engaged in “free association,” letting their minds wander. The acronym  REST  was intentionally ironic; we suspected that the association regions of the brain would actually be wildly active during this state. This suspicion was based on what we had learned about free association from the psychoanalytic approach to understanding the mind. In the hands of Freud and other psychoanalysts, free association—spontaneously saying whatever comes to mind without censorship—became a window into understanding unconscious processes. Based on my interviews with the creative subjects in my workshop study, and from additional conversations with artists, I knew that such unconscious processes are an important component of creativity. For example, Neil Simon told me: “I don’t write consciously—it is as if the muse sits on my shoulder” and “I slip into a state that is apart from reality.” (Examples from history suggest the same thing. Samuel Taylor Coleridge once described how he composed an entire 300-line poem about Kubla Khan while in an opiate-induced, dreamlike state, and began writing it down when he awoke; he said he then lost most of it when he got interrupted and called away on an errand—thus the finished poem he published was but a fragment of what originally came to him in his dreamlike state.) Based on all this, I surmised that observing which parts of the brain are most active during free association would give us clues about the neural basis of creativity. And what did we find? Sure enough, the association cortices were wildly active during  REST . I realized that I obviously couldn’t capture the entire creative process—instead, I could home in on the parts of the brain that make creativity possible. Once I arrived at this idea, the design for the imaging studies was obvious: I needed to compare the brains of highly creative people with those of control subjects as they engaged in tasks that activated their association cortices. For years, I had been asking myself what might be special or unique about the brains of the workshop writers I had studied. In my own version of a eureka moment, the answer finally came to me: creative people are better at recognizing relationships, making associations and connections, and seeing things in an original way—seeing things that others cannot see. To test this capacity, I needed to study the regions of the brain that go crazy when you let your thoughts wander. I needed to target the association cortices. In addition to  REST , I could observe people performing simple tasks that are easy to do in an MRI scanner, such as word association, which would permit me to compare highly creative people—who have that “genie in the brain”—with the members of a control group matched by age and education and gender, people who have “ordinary creativity” and who have not achieved the levels of recognition that characterize highly creative people. I was ready to design Creativity Study II. This time around,  I wanted to examine a more diverse sample of creativity, from the sciences as well as the arts. My motivations were partly selfish—I wanted the chance to discuss the creative process with people who might think and work differently, and I thought I could probably learn a lot by listening to just a few people from specific scientific fields. After all, each would be an individual jewel—a fascinating study on his or her own. Now that I’m about halfway through the study, I can say that this is exactly what has happened. My individual jewels so far include, among others, the filmmaker George Lucas, the mathematician and Fields Medalist William Thurston, the Pulitzer Prize–winning novelist Jane Smiley, and six Nobel laureates from the fields of chemistry, physics, and physiology or medicine. Because winners of major awards are typically older, and because I wanted to include some younger people, I’ve also recruited winners of the National Institutes of Health Pioneer Award and other prizes in the arts. Apart from stating their names, I do not have permission to reveal individual information about my subjects. And because the study is ongoing (each subject can take as long as a year to recruit, making for slow progress), we do not yet have any definitive results—though we do have a good sense of the direction that things are taking. By studying the structural and functional characteristics of subjects’ brains in addition to their personal and family histories, we are learning an enormous amount about how creativity occurs in the brain, as well as whether these scientists and artists display the same personal or familial connections to mental illness that the subjects in my Iowa Writers’ Workshop study did. To participate in the study, each subject spends three days in Iowa City, since it is important to conduct the research using the same MRI scanner. The subjects and I typically get to know each other over dinner at my home (and a bottle of Bordeaux from my cellar), and by prowling my 40-acre nature retreat in an all-terrain vehicle, observing whatever wildlife happens to be wandering around. Relaxing together and getting a sense of each other’s human side is helpful going into the day and a half of brain scans and challenging conversations that will follow. We begin the actual study with an MRI scan, during which subjects perform three different tasks, in addition to  REST:  word association, picture association, and pattern recognition. Each experimental task alternates with a control task; during word association, for example, subjects are shown words on a screen and asked to either think of the first word that comes to mind (the experimental task) or silently repeat the word they see (the control task). Speaking disrupts the scanning process, so subjects silently indicate when they have completed a task by pressing a button on a keypad. Playing word games inside a thumping, screeching hollow tube seems like a far cry from the kind of meandering, spontaneous discovery process that we tend to associate with creativity. It is, however, as close as one can come to a proxy for that experience, apart from  REST . You cannot force creativity to happen—every creative person can attest to that. But the essence of creativity is making connections and solving puzzles. The design of these MRI tasks permits us to visualize what is happening in the creative brain when it’s doing those things. As I hypothesized, the creative people have shown stronger activations in their association cortices during all four tasks than the controls have. (See the images on page 74.) This pattern has held true for both the artists and the scientists, suggesting that similar brain processes may underlie a broad spectrum of creative expression. Common stereotypes about “right brained” versus “left brained” people notwithstanding, this parallel makes sense. Many creative people are polymaths, people with broad interests in many fields—a common trait among my study subjects. After the brain scans, I settle in with subjects for an in-depth interview. Preparing for these interviews can be fun (rewatching all of George Lucas’s films, for example, or reading Jane Smiley’s collected works) as well as challenging (toughing through mathematics papers by William Thurston). I begin by asking subjects about their life history—where they grew up, where they went to school, what activities they enjoyed. I ask about their parents—their education, occupation, and parenting style—and about how the family got along. I learn about brothers, sisters, and children, and get a sense for who else in a subject’s family is or has been creative and how creativity may have been nurtured at home. We talk about how the subjects managed the challenges of growing up, any early interests and hobbies (particularly those related to the creative activities they pursue as adults), dating patterns, life in college and graduate school, marriages, and child-rearing. I ask them to describe a typical day at work and to think through how they have achieved such a high level of creativity. (One thing I’ve learned from this line of questioning is that creative people work much harder than the average person—and usually that’s because they love their work.) One of the most personal and sometimes painful parts of the interview is when I ask about mental illness in subjects’ families as well as in their own lives. They’ve told me about such childhood experiences as having a mother commit suicide or watching ugly outbreaks of violence between two alcoholic parents, and the pain and scars that these experiences have inflicted. (Two of the 13 creative subjects in my current study have lost a parent to suicide—a rate many times that of the general U.S. population.) Talking with those subjects who have suffered from a mental illness themselves, I hear about how it has affected their work and how they have learned to cope. So far, this study —which has examined 13 creative geniuses and 13 controls—has borne out a link between mental illness and creativity similar to the one I found in my Writers’ Workshop study. The creative subjects and their relatives have a higher rate of mental illness than the controls and their relatives do (though not as high a rate as I found in the first study), with the frequency being fairly even across the artists and the scientists. The most-common diagnoses include bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety or panic disorder, and alcoholism. I’ve also found some evidence supporting my early hypothesis that exceptionally creative people are more likely than control subjects to have one or more first-degree relatives with schizophrenia. Interestingly, when the physician and researcher Jon L. Karlsson examined the relatives of everyone listed in Iceland’s version of  Who’s Who  in the 1940s and ’60s, he found that they had higher-than-average rates of schizophrenia. Leonard Heston, a former psychiatric colleague of mine at Iowa, conducted an influential study of the children of schizophrenic mothers raised from infancy by foster or adoptive parents, and found that more than 10 percent of these children developed schizophrenia, as compared with zero percent of a control group. This suggests a powerful genetic component to schizophrenia. Heston and I discussed whether some particularly creative people owe their gifts to a subclinical variant of schizophrenia that loosens their associative links sufficiently to enhance their creativity but not enough to make them mentally ill. As in the first study, I’ve also found that creativity tends to run in families, and to take diverse forms. In this arena, nurture clearly plays a strong role. Half the subjects come from very high-achieving backgrounds, with at least one parent who has a doctoral degree. The majority grew up in an environment where learning and education were highly valued. This is how one person described his childhood: Our family evenings—just everybody sitting around working. We’d all be in the same room, and [my mother] would be working on her papers, preparing her lesson plans, and my father had huge stacks of papers and journals … This was before laptops, and so it was all paper-based. And I’d be sitting there with my homework, and my sisters are reading. And we’d just spend a few hours every night for 10 to 15 years—that’s how it was. Just working together. No TV. So why do these highly gifted people experience mental illness at a higher-than-average rate? Given that (as a group) their family members have higher rates than those that occur in the general population or in the matched comparison group, we must suspect that nature plays a role—that Francis Galton and others were right about the role of hereditary factors in people’s predisposition to both creativity and mental illness. We can only speculate about what those factors might be, but there are some clues in how these people describe themselves and their lifestyles. One possible contributory factor is a personality style shared by many of my creative subjects. These subjects are adventuresome and exploratory. They take risks. Particularly in science, the best work tends to occur in new frontiers. (As a popular saying among scientists goes: “When you work at the cutting edge, you are likely to bleed.”) They have to confront doubt and rejection. And yet they have to persist in spite of that, because they believe strongly in the value of what they do. This can lead to psychic pain, which may manifest itself as depression or anxiety, or lead people to attempt to reduce their discomfort by turning to pain relievers such as alcohol. I’ve been struck by how many of these people refer to their most creative ideas as “obvious.” Since these ideas are almost always the opposite of obvious to other people, creative luminaries can face doubt and resistance when advocating for them. As one artist told me, “The funny thing about [one’s own] talent is that you are blind to it. You just can’t see what it is when you have it … When you have talent and see things in a particular way, you are amazed that other people can’t see it.” Persisting in the face of doubt or rejection, for artists or for scientists, can be a lonely path—one that may also partially explain why some of these people experience mental illness. One interesting paradox  that has emerged during conversations with subjects about their creative processes is that, though many of them suffer from mood and anxiety disorders, they associate their gifts with strong feelings of joy and excitement. “Doing good science is simply the most pleasurable thing anyone can do,” one scientist told me. “It is like having good sex. It excites you all over and makes you feel as if you are all-powerful and complete.” This is reminiscent of what creative geniuses throughout history have said. For instance, here’s Tchaikovsky, the composer, writing in the mid-19th century: It would be vain to try to put into words that immeasurable sense of bliss which comes over me directly a new idea awakens in me and begins to assume a different form. I forget everything and behave like a madman. Everything within me starts pulsing and quivering; hardly have I begun the sketch ere one thought follows another. Another of my subjects, a neuroscientist and an inventor, told me, “There is no greater joy that I have in my life than having an idea that’s a good idea. At that moment it pops into my head, it is so deeply satisfying and rewarding … My nucleus accumbens is probably going nuts when it happens.” (The nucleus accumbens, at the core of the brain’s reward system, is activated by pleasure, whether it comes from eating good food or receiving money or taking euphoria-inducing drugs.) As for how these ideas emerge, almost all of my subjects confirmed that when eureka moments occur, they tend to be precipitated by long periods of preparation and incubation, and to strike when the mind is relaxed—during that state we called  REST . “A lot of it happens when you are doing one thing and you’re not thinking about what your mind is doing,” one of the artists in my study told me. “I’m either watching television, I’m reading a book, and I make a connection … It may have nothing to do with what I am doing, but somehow or other you see something or hear something or do something, and it pops that connection together.” Many subjects mentioned lighting on ideas while showering, driving, or exercising. One described a more unusual regimen involving an afternoon nap: “It’s during this nap that I get a lot of my work done. I find that when the ideas come to me, they come as I’m falling asleep, they come as I’m waking up, they come if I’m sitting in the tub. I don’t normally take baths … but sometimes I’ll just go in there and have a think.” Some of the  other most common findings my studies have suggested include: Many creative people are autodidacts.  They like to teach themselves, rather than be spoon-fed information or knowledge in standard educational settings. Famously, three Silicon Valley creative geniuses have been college dropouts: Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg. Steve Jobs—for many, the archetype of the creative person—popularized the motto “ Think different .” Because their thinking is different, my subjects often express the idea that standard ways of learning and teaching are not always helpful and may even be distracting, and that they prefer to learn on their own. Many of my subjects taught themselves to read before even starting school, and many have read widely throughout their lives. For example, in his article “On Proof and Progress in Mathematics,” Bill Thurston wrote: My mathematical education was rather independent and idiosyncratic, where for a number of years I learned things on my own, developing personal mental models for how to think about mathematics. This has often been a big advantage for me in thinking about mathematics, because it’s easy to pick up later the standard mental models shared by groups of mathematicians. This observation has important implications for the education of creatively gifted children. They need to be allowed and even encouraged to “think different.” (Several subjects described to me how they would get in trouble in school for pointing out when their teachers said things that they knew to be wrong, such as when a second-grade teacher explained to one of my subjects that light and sound are both waves and travel at the same speed. The teacher did not appreciate being corrected.) Many creative people are polymaths, as historic geniuses including Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci were . George Lucas was awarded not only the National Medal of Arts in 2012 but also the National Medal of Technology in 2004. Lucas’s interests include anthropology, history, sociology, neuroscience, digital technology, architecture, and interior design. Another polymath, one of the scientists, described his love of literature: I love words, and I love the rhythms and sounds of words … [As a young child] I very rapidly built up a huge storehouse of … Shakespearean sonnets, soliloquies, poems across the whole spectrum … When I got to college, I was open to many possible careers. I actually took a creative-writing course early. I strongly considered being a novelist or a writer or a poet, because I love words that much … [But for] the academics, it’s not so much about the beauty of the words. So I found that dissatisfying, and I took some biology courses, some quantum courses. I really clicked with biology. It seemed like a complex system that was tractable, beautiful, important. And so I chose biochemistry. The arts and the sciences are seen as separate tracks, and students are encouraged to specialize in one or the other. If we wish to nurture creative students, this may be a serious error. Creative people tend to be very persistent, even when confronted with skepticism or rejection.  Asked what it takes to be a successful scientist, one replied: Perseverance … In order to have that freedom to find things out, you have to have perseverance … The grant doesn’t get funded, and the next day you get up, and you put the next foot in front, and you keep putting your foot in front … I still take things personally. I don’t get a grant, and … I’m upset for days. And then I sit down and I write the grant again. Do creative people  simply have  more  ideas, and therefore differ from average people only in a quantitative way, or are they also qualitatively different? One subject, a neuroscientist and an inventor, addressed this question in an interesting way, conceptualizing the matter in terms of kites and strings: In the R&D business, we kind of lump people into two categories: inventors and engineers. The inventor is the kite kind of person. They have a zillion ideas and they come up with great first prototypes. But generally an inventor … is not a tidy person. He sees the big picture and … [is] constantly lashing something together that doesn’t really work. And then the engineers are the strings, the craftsmen [who pick out a good idea] and make it really practical. So, one is about a good idea, the other is about … making it practical. Of course, having too many ideas can be dangerous. One subject, a scientist who happens to be both a kite and a string, described to me “a willingness to take an enormous risk with your whole heart and soul and mind on something where you know the impact—if it worked—would be utterly transformative.” The  if  here is significant. Part of what comes with seeing connections no one else sees is that not all of these connections actually exist. “Everybody has crazy things they want to try,” that same subject told me. “Part of creativity is picking the little bubbles that come up to your conscious mind, and picking which one to let grow and which one to give access to more of your mind, and then have that translate into action.” In  A Beautiful Mind , her biography of the mathematician John Nash, Sylvia Nasar describes a visit Nash received from a fellow mathematician while institutionalized at McLean Hospital. “How could you, a mathematician, a man devoted to reason and logical truth,” the colleague asked, “believe that extraterrestrials are sending you messages? How could you believe that you are being recruited by aliens from outer space to save the world?” To which Nash replied: “Because the ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas did. So I took them seriously.” Some people see things others cannot, and they are right, and we call them creative geniuses. Some people see things others cannot, and they are wrong, and we call them mentally ill. And some people, like John Nash, are both. This article originally appeared at The Atlantic .

In 1926, the disparate relationship between an artwork and its textural description led to one of the most significant clashes of art and law in history: the case of Brancusi v. United States. Constantin Brancusi (1876–1957) was born in Romania, but from 1904 he lived and worked as a sculptor in Paris. He was preoccupied by the theme of the bird, culminating in the sculpture Bird in Space , of which he made 15 versions in marble and bronze and a number of plaster casts. ( MoMA’s 1928 bronze version is shown at left.) Brancusi sought to convey the essential nature of a bird, elegantly soaring upward in flight, without the need for traditional representational forms. In 1926, Brancusi created a sculpture of Bird in Space (now in the collection of the Seattle Art Museum) and sent it from Paris to New York City for an exhibition of his work at the Brummer Gallery (curated by his great friend and advocate Marcel Duchamp). Although the law permitted artworks, including sculpture, to enter the U.S. free from import taxes, when Bird arrived, officials refused to let it enter as art. To qualify as “sculpture,” works had to be “reproductions by carving or casting, imitations of natural objects, chiefly the human form” (source: Rowell ). Because Bird in Space did not look much like a bird at all, officials classified it as a utilitarian object (under “Kitchen Utensils and Hospital Supplies”) and levied against it 40% of the work’s value (source: McClean ). Bewildered and exasperated by this assessment, Brancusi launched a complaint in court in defense of Bird in Space .   The initial question before the court was whether Brancusi’s work adequately resembled that which it was supposed to “imitate,” as indicated by its title. Passing that test would make it a sculpture (and therefore art) and exempt it from customs duties. The task of the trial became, however, how to define “sculpture”—and, for that matter, “art.” Testimony was provided by a number of experts, including the sculpture’s owner, Edward Steichen, an artist and future director of MoMA’s Department of Photography, as well as British sculptor Jacob Epstein and Brooklyn Museum Director William Henry Fox. During his testimony, the art critic Frank Crowninshield was asked by the court what it was about the object which would lead him to believe it was a bird. He responded: “It has the suggestion of flight, it suggests grace, aspiration, vigour, coupled with speed in the spirit of strength, potency, beauty, just as a bird does. But just the name, the title, of this work, why, really, it does not mean much” (Rowell). Ultimately, the court was persuaded that its definition of what constituted art was out of date. The decision of Judge J. Waite read, “In the meanwhile there has been developing a so-called new school of art, whose exponents attempt to portray abstract ideas rather than imitate natural objects. Whether or not we are in sympathy with these newer ideas and the schools which represent them, we think the facts of their existence and their influence upon the art worlds as recognized by the courts must be considered” (Rowell). In the 90 years since Constantin Brancusi first conceived Bird in Space , our understanding of what constitutes an artwork, and for that matter, who can occupy the role of artist, has become broader and more inclusive. How do you recognize what is and is not a work of art? Does an artwork’s title help you interpret an artwork? Is a title necessary to give the artwork meaning? MoMA’s version of Bird in Space will be on view in the fifth-floor Painting and Sculpture Galleries beginning Friday, July 25.", "score"=>178.87793, "summaryTitle"=>"“BUT IS IT ART?” CONSTANTIN BRANCUSI VS.

There were over 40 victims in the apartment complex alone.   Police say the suspects went after the tires, slashing one after another.   But police tell 10TV the vandals also spray painted cars with graffiti. Residents were left wondering why someone would do so much damage.   “I started to do a property walk and noticed that every street had 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 cars vandalized, so I immediately called the cops,” says Preston Hutchins, one of the victims. Police believe it may be the work of more than just one person.  They're hoping surveillance video captured people slashing the tires. In the meantime, all they can do is make repair-after-repair and hope whoever is responsible will ultimately pay.   Police also say they found four cars in the parking lot of a Sams Club vandalized.   The parking lot is only several hundred yards from the apartment complex.   Police are hoping surveillance video from the store will shed some light into who caused all this damage. ©2014 by 10TV.com.

You have to be a keeper at home.” Keeper at home.  It’s a phrase from the King James translation of Titus 2, and we interpreted it to mean that it was against God’s laws for women to be employed. Our church, however, took it one step further: if all a woman was allowed to be was a “keeper at home,” then it was utterly pointless for her to try to be anything else. Pursuing an education, or longing for a career could do nothing but harm her with shattered dreams. For that reason, young women in our church were asked to be “stay-at-home daughters.”  I gave up my dreams. I sacrificed them on the altar of biblical womanhood, fervently believing that the only way I could be blessed by God was to follow the clear guidelines laid out in Scripture. I was committed to remaining at home until I was married, when my father would transfer his ownership of me to my husband, giving me away at the altar with his blessing after a brief, paternally-guided courtship. Occasionally, a snatch of a dream would intrude. No, Samantha. My inner voice would be harsh, echoing my Sunday school teachers and pastor’s wife. Do not be tempted. That’s just the Devil trying to trick you away from God’s plan. I looked to the other women in my life for inspiration—the other girls were filling their hope chests, meeting together to learn new recipes, learning to crochet and knit and sew.  I tried sewing. I almost broke my mother’s machine.  I learned how to crochet, but hated the feeling of yarn scraping around my fingers. I took up cross stitching, but gave up when all I got was a snarl of silken tangles after weeks of trying. I became a halfway-decent cook, but my heart was never in it. As for cleaning-- I perniciously avoided laundry, dusting aggravated my allergies, dragging around the canister vacuum was torture, cleaning toilets made me gag, and dishes? Dear Lord, I hated anything having to do with dishes! Learning to enjoy housework, to “take pride in the homemaking arts,” was a complete and total bust. The one thing I was good at was playing the piano. I’d started lessons when I was six, and was playing congregationally by thirteen. I devoted myself to becoming a pianist, and my mother joked that she couldn’t tear me away from the piano with a crowbar. They did everything they could to support my fanatical interest—buying a piano at a time when they could barely afford one and paying for lessons with the best piano teacher in three counties.  My senior year in high school, my piano instructor asked where I’d applied to college. When I told him I wasn’t going to college, he stared at me, dumbfounded, the lesson jerking to a dead stop. “What do you mean you’re not going to college?! Of course you’re going to college! Talent like yours can’t be hidden under a bushel.” I haltingly tried to explain about being a stay-at-home-daughter, a keeper at home, but that just seemed to confuse him more, so he dropped it. I couldn’t stop thinking about his reaction, though. I knew he was a Christian, but he didn’t seem to have heard of being a stay-at-home daughter; while I knew our church was more conservative than most, I assumed that a concept as plain as “keeper at home” would be obvious no matter what church you went to. The fact that it wasn’t clear to a person I respected, who I knew had a deep faith and was incredibly intelligent . . . bothered me.  It didn’t stop bothering me until I decided I was going to look into this. I typed “stay-at-home daughter” into Google, and found my way to a review of the documentary \"Return of the Daughters,\" a film I’d seen and that was exalted by most of the women I knew. What I read gobsmacked me—in the review and the comments, hundreds of conservative Christian women lambasted the principles taught in the film, arguing against the Botkin’s narrow interpretation of Scripture. Arguing against my interpretation of Scripture. I didn’t have to remain at home until I was married. I could go to college. It was too late for me to become an marine botanist, since I had abandoned any study of science or math in high school, but I could do something. I could get the piano performance degree my teacher was encouraging me to pursue.  As a compromise, I applied to a fundamentalist Christian liberal arts college not that far away from home. I should not have been surprised by the reaction I got when I announced my acceptance at church, but I was. I was hurt by their vindictiveness. I wasn’t ignoring what I’d been taught. I wasn’t selfishly chasing what my “deceitfully wicked heart” wanted. I just … wanted to study piano, to eventually become a housewife who taught piano lessons out of her living room. Was that so wrong? I went anyway, ignoring the pleas of my best friend and nearly every woman I’d ever respected not to do something so totally opposed to “biblical teaching.” I went, and I blossomed. My sophomore year I decided to switch to a secondary education degree because I realized I didn’t want to spend my entire life at home. I wanted to be able to get a job. I spent the next few years fighting with nearly everyone back home about my decision, ignoring all the packets and booklets offering me more “biblical alternatives” like taking “at-home college-level courses in biblical homemaking.” My senior year I completed a teaching internship and realized that I loathed almost everything about being a teacher. I woke up, brutally aware that I’d spent thousands of dollars and four and half years earning a degree that I’d never actually wanted, all because the people I’d grown up with had told me I couldn’t be anything else except a housewife who could use her teaching degree to homeschool her children. So I found an English graduate program that would accept my credits and applied. When I told the people from my childhood who were still in my life, they tsked. One told me that she would be praying that I would be “led back to God’s true will for my life,” and that he would use my “errant heart to teach me his ways.” Another accused me of openly rebelling against God. It hit me the hardest that my parents, who up until this point had fought for my right to go to college if I wanted, suddenly and inexplicably withdrew their support. When I showed my mother the university I wanted to attend, her only response was a solemn “you’ll need to ask your father.” My father’s answer was disheartening. He did not like the idea of me going to a college so far away from home, so far away from the “umbrella of his protection.” Why couldn’t I stay at home? Take online courses if I wanted a master’s degree? My attempts to explain online literature courses aren’t what I want were met with more reservations and protests. It wasn’t fitting for an unmarried daughter to live on her own. I was accepted into the program, but they didn’t have any spots left to become a graduate assistant. Without any way to pay for it, I went home. I didn’t give up, though. I started taking online courses and began pocketing away all of the money I could—I would get to grad school, one way or another. Eight months later, the director of the GA program called me: a spot had opened up, was I interested? So nervous I was sick, I called my father—and after eight months of him watching me work and save and study and read and write, he’d changed his mind. I wanted a master’s degree, and that was enough. Graduate school was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done. Being thrown into an environment so different from what I’d known as a fundamentalist Christian was overwhelming at times, and I spent those two years catching up on everything I should have learned but never had the opportunity to. In that time, my parents also left Christian fundamentalism and the stay-at-home movement—my mother even got a job, working “outside the home,” and she loves it. It’s been a bumpy road at times, but we’re the better for it, I think. Today, when I hear stories about young women forgoing college in order to “serve their fathers” or “study to be a good wife,” my heart breaks. I had people in my life who pushed me into considering college, but not every stay-at-home daughter has that. For most of my life I was utterly convinced that staying at home was what I wanted, a personal conviction that I had. It took me six years and two degrees in order for me to fully realize that it wasn’t something I ever would have chosen for myself if I’d been truly allowed to consider any other option. Looking back at everything I went through, I realize now how important it is for women to be able to explore all of who they really are, to claim their spiritual gifts and God-given talents.  *** Be sure to check out Samantha's blog for more! ", "score"=>178.65897, "summaryTitle"=>"Leaving Home: Escaping the Stay-at-Home Daughters Movement (by Samantha Field)", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/samantha-field-stay-at-home-daughters", "referrer"=>["bing.com", "wordpress.com", "direct", "t.co", "twitterrific.com", "facebook.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1pTt6fx", "lastseen"=>"20140726004731", "page"=>"http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/samantha-field-stay-at-home-daughters", "ogtitle"=>"Leaving Home: Escaping the Stay-at-Home Daughters Movement (by Samantha Field)"}, {"domain"=>"hollywoodreporter.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406322865000", "h2"=>["\"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\" alum Alexander Siddig is set to play Oberyn's older brother, while Myrcella will now be played by Nell Tiger Free.", "Photo Gallery", "Top Galleries", "What's Hot in TV", "Follow the Feed", "What's Hot On The Hollywood Reporter"], "h3"=>["Hollywood's Notable Deaths of 2014", "Behind the Scenes of 'The Big Bang Theory'", "'The Big Bang Theory's' Nerdiest Guest Stars", "Titans of Comic-Con: Stars Re-Create Classic Characters (Photos)", "'The Good Wife,' Tatiana Maslany and 18 More of the Biggest Emmy Snubs (Photos)", "Behind the Scenes of 'The Big Bang Theory'", "Titans of Comic-Con: Stars Re-Create Classic Characters (Photos)", "'The Big Bang Theory's' Nerdiest Guest Stars", "Hollywood's Notable Deaths of 2014"], "site"=>"www.hollywoodreporter.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004406", "keywords"=>"Television,Comic-Con 2014,Comic-Con,Game of Thrones", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335446525", "title"=>"Comic-Con: 'Game of Thrones' Casts Key Season 5 Characters - Hollywood Reporter", "initial"=>"20140725211425", "summaryText"=>"'The Big Bang Theory's' Nerdiest Guest Stars", "content"=>"'The Big Bang Theory's' Nerdiest Guest Stars", "score"=>178.63255, "summaryTitle"=>"Comic-Con: 'Game of Thrones' Casts Key Season 5 Characters", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Game of Thrones is bringing in plenty of new players for season five.

(GOAT, of course, stands for Greatest Of All Time.)   Sure, Andre Johnson would never announce his arrival with such fanfare, but his training camp arrival spoke volumes. For the past two or three months, many speculated, guessticulated (if that's a word) and surmised what they felt they knew about all of the players in this situation - Dre, Bill O'Brien, Rick Smith and the entire Texans organization. In the end, most media pundits marjorly missed the mark but that can be a story for someone else to write and sensationalize on his/her own.   I'm here to talk about what it means, on the field, for Andre and this offense. This is a true football discussion. I'll address the how and the where, and stay quiet on the rest.   Just as Dre would want. It's time to work.   How will he fit in this offense? Let's start by going deep. Past history can help us a little bit but not entirely. O'Brien's never really had a receiver quite like Dre. Sure, Randy Moss could run the 9-route like no other, but he wasn't going to win on the digs, curls and in-cuts as Johnson does. Wes Welker dominated the short to intermediate areas, but he didn't often pose a threat vertically like Dre does.   Andre isn't the deep threat that Moss was and isn't Welker. But Andre's the consummate combination of the two. He's not going to fly by corners in man coverage, but he has such good ball skills on deep balls that he doesn't need to have two steps or one, he just needs to be in the vicinity to make the catch. Furthermore, he's such a good route runner that double moves can get him open by yards as it did against Colts CB Vontae Davis last year at home.   Throwing the ball deep needs three components: Coach/playcaller to WANT to throw deep, a QB to do so and a receiver with the ability to get there.   O'Brien's made no bones about his desire to push the ball down the field. Texans' quarterbacks have both the arm and the desire to throw it deep. And finally, Dre can still get down the field. Although it didn't happen, Dre's absence wouldn't have precluded the Texans from throwing the ball deep, but his presence makes that level of the field ultra-dangerous.   The next question is \"Where does Dre line up?\".   Anywhere the staff wants, honestly. The challenge for Johnson is to learn nearly every route from every receiving position. He does need to learn new terminology and concepts but he's learned multiple receiving responsibilties in the past. Aligning off the ball is optimal for Johnson. When he goes in motion, defenses may show their hand, coverage-wise. He can line up alongside DeAndre Hopkins . He can line up next to Arian Foster . He can line up inside at a slot position. If a defense's number one priority is shutting him down, his movement throws a distinct monkey wrench into a defense's plans. Furthermore, his presence opens up so much in the passing game for the capable weapons in the Texans' stable.   The opportunities are limitless. I don't think we'll see Andre get any carries out of the backfield but then again the imagination of this offensive staff is without boundaries so I would never write it completely off. Advise against it? Sure. But, if it puts the ball in his hands...   That elicits a smile to think about Dre catching passes for the Texans in 2014. It's just great to know that he'll be here on Saturday to have the ball in his hands and retain his crown as the GOAT.", "score"=>178.48286, "summaryTitle"=>"New spot in offense for Andre Johnson&nbsp;", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Texans Analyst John Harris explained where Andre Johnson will line up in the new Texans offense.", "cities"=>"us-tx-houston", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.houstontexans.com/news/article-2/New-spot-in-offense-for-Andre-Johnson/2b358d7a-0708-4dc7-99bb-3875703110f7", "referrer"=>["houstontexans.com", "direct", "t.co", "chron.com", "bleacherreport.com", "facebook.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1nDvqsy", "lastseen"=>"20140726004332", "page"=>"http://www.houstontexans.com/news/article-2/new-spot-in-offense-for-andre-johnson/2b358d7a-0708-4dc7-99bb-3875703110f7", "ogtitle"=>"New spot in offense for Andre Johnson&nbsp;"}, {"domain"=>"thelocal.de", "initial_epoch"=>"1406304040000", "h2"=>["The workers Germany needs the most", "Germany basks in World Cup glory", "Germany's World Cup winners party in Berlin", "Three killed during World Cup celebrations", "Football chief: No offence meant by 'gaucho' dance", "Germany vs. Argentina: Who does history favour?", "Bangladesh farmer makes huge German flag", "The most expensive German cities for expats", "Germany beat Argentina 1:0 to win World Cup", "Should Germany ban the burqa?", "Your comments about this article"], "site"=>"www.thelocal.de", "lastindexed"=>"20140726003100", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406334660443", "title"=>"Germany tops table for energy efficiency - The Local", "initial"=>"20140725160040", "summaryText"=>"Photo: DPA Published: 18 Jul 2014 14:42 GMT+02:00 Updated: 18 Jul 2014 14:42 GMT+02:00 Germany is the most energy efficient country in the world, according to rankings by an environmental group.

The report's ranking system looked at energy use, energy savings targets, fuel economy standards for vehicles and energy efficiency standards for appliances to come up with the rankings. Henning Ellermann, an energy efficiency expert at Germany Trade & Invest was not surprised by his country's favourable ranking. \"Germany has been pushing this topic for about three to four decades and was one of the earliest in the field,\" he told The Local. Ellermann credited the German mindset for the success. \"Getting people to save energy in Germany is not a hard sell,\" he said. Among the measurements, the report lauded Germany's plan to reduce primary energy consumption by 20 percent by 2020, and 50 percent by 2050, based on levels in 2008. \"Germany has a strong energy efficiency strategy built into a much larger framework,\" Ellerman said. \"And this makes it much easier for these efforts to succeed.\" The council awarded the country first place for energy efficiency in the industrial sector, where the government has mandatory codes on both residential and commercial buildings. Such requirements have opened the door to energy-efficiency companies looking to gain a presence in Germany. Ellermann mentioned an increase in businesses working in non-traditional energy efficiency sectors, like IT. \"Right now we are seeing a lot of data driven and IT driven ideas in home and building efficiency,” he said. Energiewende blows cold? German consumers, meanwhile, appear increasingly critical of the country’s switch to green energy, known as the Energiewende, according to a study released on Friday. The GfK Global Green Index, a study into consumers’ attitudes, found Germans are losing patience with high energy bills brought about by the switch to green energy. Less than half (46 percent) of Germans said they were prepared to accept higher energy bills as a price for the switch, down from 56 percent when Chancellor Angela Merkel announced the Energiewende in 2011. Among the over 65s, support has fallen from 64 percent to 40 percent over the last three years, GfK said. Willingness to see new power lines and grids put up, a necessary step for the Energiewende to succeed, has also declined from 75 percent in 2011 to 62 percent in 2014.

The man punched Ortega in the face and fled the restaurant, said Los Angeles Police Department West Bureau homicide Det. Steven Katz. Ortega filed a battery report and told police officers he would seek his own medical care, Katz said. Two days later, Ortega checked himself into Kaiser Permanente Medical Center and complained of a headache and vomiting, Katz said. He died from his injuries July 14. The coronor's office determined Wednesday that Ortega died of blunt force trauma and listed his death as a homicide, Katz said. \"It's a sad thing,\" he said. \"Mr. Ortega is a good Samaritan.\" Comments 0 It's unknown why the man was screaming at the child, Katz said, adding it did not appear the attacker had any relationship with the child.

Noah, whose Noah’s Arc Foundation regularly hosts events at the", "content"=>"Surrounded by small children at the Major Adams Community Center, walking distance from the United Center, aside from his seven-foot height, Bulls’ All-Star center Joakim Noah fit right in. Noah, whose Noah’s Arc Foundation regularly hosts events at the facility, was in town Friday to announce an anti-violence initiative in Chicago and aired a public-service announcement which also featured teammate Derrick Rose. But while the focus of the day was off the court, Noah did address his occupation, beginning with the Bulls’ active offseason. “I’m really excited. I think Gar [Forman, the Bulls’ general manager] and ‘Pax’ [John Paxson, the Bulls’ executive vice president], they did a really good job. It just makes you want to work hard and be ready as possible for the upcoming season,” he said. “Even when we sucked, I always felt like we had championship aspirations. I don’t go into a game thinking we’re going to lose, ever. I don’t care who we play against. But obviously, we feel like there’s a lot of things that go into it. You’ve got to be lucky, the chemistry has to be great. A lot of things need to go your way to win a championship. So we feel like we’ve dealt with a lot of adversity and I think that adversity is going to help us in the long run because our team is hungry, our team is working—it’s the middle of the summer and guys are working out every day—and only time will tell, but it’s exciting.” One of the reasons for Noah’s optimism is the arrival of veteran big man Pau Gasol, whom his new teammate helped recruit in Los Angeles during the early stages of NBA free agency. “I think it’s going to be great and Pau is somebody who’s very, very smart. His father is a doctor, I think. He’s somebody who comes with a lot of experience,” Noah said about Gasol. “Not just a great player, but somebody who cares about the community, as well. So I’m excited to see him help us, as well. Try to slow down the violence and help the kids out here in Chicago. It’s very humbling to play with somebody who’s won championships and his pedigree, he’s somebody I can really learn from.” [MORE: Taj Gibson admits trade rumors are tough to go through ] Noah also spoke about the aforementioned Rose’s progress in recovering from his second major knee injury and subsequent surgery. “I’m really proud of him because he sacrificed his whole summer. He sacrificed a lot to be the best that he can and that’s all you can do. People’s expectations, all that stuff doesn’t matter,” Noah explained. “I’m proud of him for putting in the work that he put in to be in the best position possible and he’s doing a lot of things. He’s helping us out, too, with our foundation and I have nothing but love for him.” As for his own health, Noah, who quietly had knee surgery after the season, said he’s doing well, as exhibited by dunking in the community center’s gym. “Rehabbing every day. Usually, I go out a lot more and really don’t do anything the first month and a half after the season. But I had to start rehabbing right away and I think that it all goes together,” he said. “I think that the better we do on the court, the bigger our foundation gets and the more work we can do in the community. So I know that they go hand in hand, but all this stuff that we’re doing in the community gives me strength. It makes me feel like playing for more than just winning and losing.” [MORE: New offensive firepower gives Thibodeau plenty to work with ] A major part of the Bulls’ free-agency strategy, Noah also reflected on the organization’s failed pursuit of Carmelo Anthony. “No, I think he did the right decision for him. We obviously recruited him pretty hard, but I think that he had to make the best decision for him and I’m really excited about our team the way it is,” Noah said. “I think we’re deeper and I think those are things that—me personally, I can’t control where another man goes—so if he feels that New York is the best position for him, I’m happy for him. But at the end of the day, what I care about is this city and the Chicago Bulls.” The league’s reigning Defensive Player of the Year also shared his thoughts on LeBron James’ return to Cleveland. “Good for LeBron. I’m happy for LeBron James. He gets to go home and people are happy over there, but I really hope that we can kick his [expletive] as many times as possible,” Noah quipped.", "score"=>178.03734, "summaryTitle"=>"Joakim Noah discusses new-look Bulls' title hopes", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>"us-il", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.csnchicago.com/bulls/joakim-noah-discusses-new-look-bulls-title-hopes", "referrer"=>["hoopshype.com", "direct", "fancloud.com", "t.co", "sportsmanias.com", "bleacherreport.com", "csnchicago.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1lEV4J9", "lastseen"=>"20140726004334", "page"=>"http://www.csnchicago.com/bulls/joakim-noah-discusses-new-look-bulls-title-hopes", "ogtitle"=>"Joakim Noah discusses new-look Bulls&#039; title hopes"}, {"domain"=>"funnyordie.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406308940000", "h2"=>["Funny or Die", "Features", "Celebrities See All", "Quick Links", "best GOAT"], "h3"=>["From Around the Web", "Featured Today"], "site"=>"www.funnyordie.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004424", "keywords"=>"funny, pics, funny pics, gifs, funny gifs, best gifs, lol gifs, lol, best of the week, gifdump, picdump, animals, cats, dogs, dog gifs, cat gifs, funny cat gifs, dancing gifs, old man dancing, sports, sports gifs, basketball gifs, fails, falls, track and field, cute", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335464661", "title"=>"21 Best GIFs of All Time of the Week from best GOAT", "initial"=>"20140725172220", "summaryText"=>"Copyright © 2014 Funny or Die Inc.

Ibe has been impressive throughout pre-season and has started all three games so far – including Liverpool's 1-0 defeat to Roma at Fenway Park. Thousands of Reds fans have turned out over the course of Liverpool's stay in the city, something which has helped the winger to focus. “It shows how big the club is and reminds me of how big of an opportunity it is for me, the young players and even the senior players,” Ibe told the ECHO. “I'm just trying to grab the opportunities I get and hopefully I take them.” Jordon Ibe   Ibe was given 75 minutes against the Serie A side on Wednesday, but was shifted to the right hand side after the injury to Fabio Borini. Reds boss Brendan Rodgers has previously spoken of the dilemma he faces in how to use Ibe this season – but the youngster is only looking at what happens during the US tour. “Hopefully I can do well, try to get a goal, and if not, then an assist,” he adds. “The most important thing for me is to enjoy the football here of what's left and catch the gaffer's eye.” Rodgers' eye has already been caught. After handing Ibe his debut at home to Queens Park Rangers on the final day of 2012/13, Ibe made two more appearances last season, before joining Birmingham City on loan and playing a crucial role in their Championship survival. The contrast between a second-tier dogfight and a tour of the US couldn't be starker, both physically and mentally. Ibe says: “[The reception] prepares us to sell all the fans with the fan base out here in America and Boston, and condition-wise it's really hot – it's not that hot in Liverpool and England – so it has been much better for us. “It's a lovely city and I'm just enjoying the training.” View gallery \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" View gallery   Ibe impressed on last year's pre-season tour of Asia and Australia, appearing in all three games, and he hopes for more of the same in America. “Hopefully I'll do well in pre-season and it will give me a chance in the Premier League or one of the cups – but we have to deal with pre-season first.” Latest LFC news Liverpool summer signing Adam Lallana sidelined for six weeks with knee injury       Liverpool agree £20m deal for Southampton defender Dejan Lovren             In pictures: Reds train in Boston for final time before heading for Chicago Live: Liverpool FC in the USA, July 25 2014 Watch: 'New £20m man Dejan Lovren can be defensive leader LFC have lacked' - James Pearce LFC transfer gossip: Reds in for £36.5m Benfica winger, Shaqiri bid mooted, latest on Vidal future Reina says he's 'here to stay' at LFC but would like to finish career in Spain Reds pre-season tour of US diary: opportunity arises as training gets serious In pictures: Liverpool FC step up pre-season training at Harvard University New Anfield contract for Steven Gerrard a formality, says Brendan Rodgers In pictures: Liverpool FC pay tribute to victims of Boston bombing WATCH: Steven Gerrard playing baseball at Fenway Park James Pearce's Liverpool FC USA tour diary: Fan is on song to lift Rodgers and his Reds What we learned from Liverpool 0 Roma 1 Rodgers satisfied with early pre-season preparations Liverpool target Chelsea left-back Ryan Bertrand but are being frustrated in attempts to wrap up £8m deal                          Rodgers insists Liverpool will not be held to ransom with their transfer targets In pictures: LFC Boston supporters club helps Reds relationship strengthen across the pond WATCH: Rodgers believes new signings will help ensure Liverpool challenge for silverware Rickie Lambert: Time to look beyond sentiment and get down to business In pictures: Rodgers returns as Reds train on boiling Boston morning Watch: Reds defender Martin Kelly aiming to put injury nightmare behind him Liverpool pursuing deal to sign Atletico Madrid full-back Javier Manquillo In Pictures: Rush, Fowler and Pizzuti help coach kids in America *You can follow Liverpool's tour of the USA every step of the way.

Mary Kay Cabot of the Cleveland Plain Dealer wrote a story , citing anonymous Browns sources, saying the team is \"alarmed\" by his actions since the draft. Manziel has been seen at various parties this offseason. The story said the team was worried enough about a photo of Manziel apparently rolling up a $20 bill that coach Mike Pettine told Cabot that he called the rookie quarterback from his vacation in Hawaii to get answers. The Plain Dealer pointed out that tight-rolled bills are often used for drug use, although there was no evidence in the photo that's what Manziel was doing, Pettine reached out to ask him about it. According to the story, Pettine said he planned to address it again with Manziel face-to-face when he reported for camp with the other rookies on Wednesday.  It isn't just the one photo, either. The Browns sources who talked to Cabot said the team was promised by Manziel before the draft that he would tone down his partying, and the Browns have been \" stunned by his non-stop antics\" since they took him. This is a big story for a few reasons. Cabot is one of the best and most respected voices on the Browns beat, so there's little doubt to the legitimacy of what she wrote. Also, take into account the timing and purpose of the story. The Browns knew the talk of Manziel's actions off the field would take a back seat to his quarterback competition with Brian Hoyer once training camp started. The Browns could have easily been quiet about their off-field satisfaction and let the narrative change to Manziel's progress as a player. The sources speaking to Cabot had to know how her story would play out, and they're likely aware that it would put the spotlight back on Manziel's partying on the day the Browns report to camp, when the media attention is high. Instead of protecting their young quarterback, some sources within the Browns set out to do the opposite. It has been less than three months since the Browns took Manziel with the 22nd overall pick, and some within the organization are already seemingly taking a combative stance with the former Heisman winner. And, there was a troubling football aspect to the story too. The story said Manziel \" regressed in practice after the first week of organized team activities,\" and the team thinks he wasn't dedicated enough to learning the playbook because he was flying around the country and partying. The story said he has already lost ground in the quarterback competition before camp starts.  Manziel has tremendous talent, which is why the Browns took him in the first place. His partying became a big story at Texas A&M, and he still was one of the greatest quarterbacks in college football history his two seasons there. All of this might blow over because Manziel gets his chance in the preseason and dominates on the field. But as Browns camp starts, the team's dissatisfaction with their rookie quarterback is in the spotlight. It seems like a message is being sent. - - - - - - - Frank Schwab is the editor of Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports. Have a tip? Email him at shutdowncorner@yahoo.com or follow him on Twitter!

One of the videos allegedly involved the children of two public personalities. The girl involved is said to be 15 years old. The videos have been making the rounds the whole week on several social media platforms, including Whatsapp. But throughout Friday, it has been impossible to share the video on Whatsapp alone. Some phone users suspect the local telcos deliberately blocked the videos based on 'orders from above'. Indeed, Adom News' attention was brought to the matter because an insider at one of the leading telcos in the country called a journalist and said 'we have been instructed to block that sex video' involving the children of the public personalities. When Adom Newsroom staff tried to share the video on Whatsapp across all the five GSM networks in Ghana it failed to be shared.   But on reaching the spokespersons of the telcos on phone, they all denied blocking the video on Whatsapp, saying 'it is not possible for us to block the sharing of content on Whatsapp.' One explained that it was possible someone with vested interest reported the sharing of that particular video directly to the owners of Whatsapp, and they blocked it from their base outside Ghana. 'It could be because the video involves a minor, someone reported it to Whatsapp and they stopped it,' another telco official said. But Ghanaians living abroad, who have those sex videos on their phones, told Adom News they are able to share the video among themselves on Whatsapp in the UK, USA and other parts of the world. An IT expert also told Adom News he suspects the local telcos may have changed some codes in the properties of the video making it impossible to share on social media. He insisted that the blocking of the video could not have been done by Whatsapp since a transfer on Whatsapp is possible in other countries except Ghana. 'We are still trying various ways of sending the video via Whatsapp - we will let you know what we find,' he said. Some staff of the telcos also said they tried various ways of resaving and sending that video on Whatsapp but it did not work. Meanwhile, a customer service official at one of the telcos said she suspects one of the public officials, whose son is allegedly involved in one of the sex videos may have pulled the strings to block the video. 'I am sure the Minister in question may have used his/her power to block the video - this is Ghana and that Minister only needs to make a call for this thing to be blocked - so please just manage with what you have and stop spreading the video,' she said. Adom News also reached telecoms regulator National Communications Authority (NCA) and they said telcos do not have control over content but the law allows them to prevent the spread of any content deemed harmful to a minor, provided someone makes a complaint.

Which", "content"=>"In 1943, the  U.S. War Department issued a manual  packed with \"informal\" games that men might play if they were lucky enough to have downtime. The games were intended to occupy mind and body, manage stress, and subtly provide tactical training. Which might explain why so many games involved tackling and beating your fellow soldiers. But other, less physical games translate great from the barracks to the backyard. Here are eight of our favorites. 1. One Out Equipment : Any easily obtained objects, such as sticks, shirts, or rocks How to play:  This is basically a game of musical chairs meant for soldiers instead of toddlers. So, no music, no graham crackers, but probably a comparable amount of shoving and punching. A line of sticks or similar objects are laid about 40 feet from the players. If there are 10 players, only 9 sticks are laid out, and so forth. At the signal, the players race to the line, \"secure\" themselves a stick, and race back. The player left stick-less is out, until only one remains. 2. Team Stick Guard Equipment : A ball and two sticks How to play : This game is a small serving of Capture the Flag with a heavy side of basketball. Each team has their own stick driven into the ground, surrounded by a 10-foot circle and a \"goalie\" to protect it. No other players are allowed in the goalie's circle. The referee begins play by throwing the ball between two men of opposing teams. The aim is for them to maneuver the ball close enough to knock the other team's stick out of the ground. Many of the rules from basketball apply: no running with the ball, holding, tripping, tackling, or touching. Such fouls results in a free throw at the opposing stick from the center of the field. The losing team is the one with the most knocked over pin. 3. Box Hockey Equipment : A homemade box (7 feet by 3.5 feet, with or without a bottom) matching the one above, two sticks, and a ball or piece of wood small enough to fit through the holes How to play : First, build the box, which probably took all of 20 minutes for men of this generation. From there, it's air hockey with less finger pinching and more accidental knee clubbing. Start the game with the ball balanced on the center partition. Clap sticks three times above the ball, and the game is on. The goal is to get the ball through your opponent's hole. If the ball is knocked out of the arena, it is rolled back in on the opposite side. No stepping inside the box; first person to five points is the winner. 4. Rooster Fight Equipment:  None How to play:  A man from each team is called out, and he must hop on one foot, hands held behind his back, to meet his opponent. The winning man is the one who knocks the other over, or causes him to put his foot down or arms out for balance. Another posture for the game is called \"The Drake,\" which is hands never leaving ankles, as shown in the circle above. (This game thinly avoids becoming bloody combat by wisely removing most dangerous appendages from the battle.) 5. Log Roll Equipment : Grassy area or floor mats How to play:  Two teams lie side by side on the ground. Starting with the end man, each player must roll over his entire team as soon as he himself is rolled over. The winner is the first team to have their front man roll over all of his men. 6. Chain Dodge Ball Equipment:  Kickball or other soft ball How to play:  This version of dodge ball adds a complex but fun twist. The men form groups of four to six players, each player holding the waist of the person in front of him. Everyone else forms a circle around them. The object is to hit only the end man of the \"It\" team with the ball. Players in the circle can toss the ball any way they think will accomplish this, and the \"It\" team can weave and run and flex in any formation possible to avoid it. The front man of the team can even use his hands to bat away the ball from the end man. The players are picked off one by one until the whole team is eliminated. Whichever team stayed inside the circle the longest is the winner. 7. Quick Line Up Equipment:  None How to play:  Simon Says with a loyal army at his feet. The players divide into four equal teams and line up, tallest to shortest, forming a square around the man who's \"It.\" The four lines are designated, \"1, 2, 3, 4.\" Now \"It\" can walk anywhere he wants on the field, and wherever he stops, the other players must scramble to reassemble their lines around him, same position, same sides. One point to the team who assembles correctly the fastest, first team to five points win. 8. Baste the Bear Equipment:  Buttocks How to play:  As full as this manual was of  beating games ,  full-on assault games , and  uncomfortably intimate games , it seemed unprincipled not to include at least one. One of the \"tamer\" rough games is Baste the Bear. The \"Bear\" in this case must bend at the center of the circle, his posterior presented. He has a \"Keeper\" whose job it is to protect his rump. The rest of the players circle, trying to slap the bear's buttocks with their open hands. If the Keeper tags a slapper when they reach toward the Bear, the slapper is the new Bear and selects his own tush guardian.

Unfortunately,", "content"=>"Gardening from Wildlife Promise 7/24/2014 // By David Mizejewski // Garden for Wildlife , snakes As National Wildlife Federation Naturalist , I frequently get questions from folks about “getting rid of” wildlife in their yard. Especially snakes. Unfortunately, most of the advice you can find online on the subject is bad. Mothballs are often suggested, but they are toxic . Commercial snake “repellants” are usually made of the same chemical. Most importantly though, they  don’t work to repel snakes anyway , so don’t waste your money. Mowing or cutting away all of the vegetation and brush in your yard removes important habitat for birds, butterflies and other backyard wildlife. So what’s a person to do when snakes show up in their garden?  The answer is sit back and enjoy it! There’s no need to eliminate snakes in your yard. Really the only problem is one of perception. Snakes are perceived as “bad” because of deep seated cultural traditions as well as psychological phobia. As a culture, we fear snakes and we reinforce that fear in our children. And yet, as a group snakes are some of the most harmless—and most important—wildlife that we can attract to our gardens. In fact, the vast majority of snakes are 100% harmless to people . Yet, the most common reaction most people have when they see a snake is to want to kill or eliminate it. At National Wildlife Federation we try to help people understand that if a snake shows up in their yard, they are doing something right. It’s something to be celebrated. It means that the yard is a healthy ecosystem that is helping wildlife of all kinds to survive. And those are the exact kinds of yards that NWF certifies via our Garden for Wildlife program. That said, we don’t encourage wildlife getting into our homes, so here are some tips to keep the snakes outside and avoid any conflicts with them: Critter-proof your attic and basement or crawl-space areas by making sure all access entry points have tight fitting doors or windows. Caulk any cracks or crevices that might allow snakes to enter. Keep screens in windows and don’t leave doors open. Keep brush or rock piles and dense vegetation away from the foundation of your house. Build brush or rock piles and plant dense vegetation on the outskirts of your property to attract snakes to those areas, away from your home. If you have rats or mice in your home, work to eliminate them as they can be viewed as a food source by snakes. Never use cruel glue traps—for rodents of for snakes. Encounters with venomous snakes in backyards are rare.  Learn what snakes are venomous in your area so you know which snakes are actually dangerous, and which are totally harmless. Here’s a great state-by-state listing of venomous snakes in North America. If you do encounter a venomous snake in your yard, don’t try to move or kill it . Call a professional wildlife removal company with experience with venomous snakes , or just let it be if children and pets aren’t present. Here are two good listing of all the snakes in North America to help you identify any snake that shows up in your yard: Snakes of North America and Discover Life’s Snake Guide . Never deliberately approach any snake or try to touch or handle it, and you’ll eliminate any chance of ever being bitten.  This goes for all wildlife. Teach this rule to children. Snakes are beautiful and important wildlife.  Enjoy them! Be a Wildlife Gardener Want to make the most out of gardening, and help wildlife?

In addition to tapping a wealth of storytelling opportunities, Gage explains in this interview how Spider-Verse presents chances for certain characters to learn more about themselves when dealing with a wide range of Spider-personalities! Marvel.com: While it is spectacular to get to team-up, say, Miles Morales with Old Man Spider-Man, how challenging is it to dialogue scenes between such vastly different versions of Spidey? Christos Gage: Well, each issue has two stories. And in the first one, my story is Old Man Spidey, Ben Reilly and Spider-Ham. Which is still quite a range of Spideys, am I right? The differences are what make it fun! It's actually harder to write dialogue between characters with very similar voice, because you want everybody to be distinct. The more different they are the better! Marvel.com: In terms of storytelling opportunities you would not have otherwise have, what's been the biggest narrative benefit to exploring this diverse Spider-Verse? Christos Gage: You get to present every character with a look at a different version of themselves. That's always a source for rich storytelling. Could I really turn out to be such a jerk? How did that guy do so much better in his life than me? I thought I had it bad, but look at that poor sap! Wait—is that a talking pig?!? Marvel.com: I know it's too early to discuss who you are collaborating with on SPIDER-VERSE TEAM-UP, but when you get the chance to team with incredible artists do you intentionally try to write scenes that allow them to draw scenes you know they do best? Christos Gage: When I know what artists I'll be working with, I always try to play to their strengths and what they enjoy doing, regardless of how long they've been working. With classic artists, there may be some temptation to go for what you know they will knock out of the park, but you can't be too fanboyish about it to the point where you're just asking them to do a greatest hits medley. The idea is to tell the best story. Personally, I love seeing artists I admire doing stuff I know they're great at, but I also love seeing them tackle new material. I got to work with the great Adam Kubert on SUPERIOR SPIDER-MAN #32 , and I got a big kick out of seeing his rendition of Superior Spider-Man as much as classic Spidey. Marvel.com: What is the key to writing a character like Spider-Ham, who inherently has more humor in him than even the original Spider-Man? Christos Gage: To stay true to the character, but not lose the humanity—so to speak. With Spider-Ham, I look at “Who Framed Roger Rabbit.” The toons are unquestionably cartoon characters, but there is an underlying humanity to them that is really poignant, without undermining the nature of the Toons. Marvel.com: I would be remiss to not ask, given that the Spider-Verse pulls together a variety of continuities into one place--dare we hope for a cameo by Johnny Storm's greatest invention, the Spider-Mobile? Christos Gage: No spoilers, but with Spider-Verse, there's a chance of pretty much anything! Can’t make it to the convention?

I spoke to Swedish national  Fred Ekblad briefly during a 15 minute lull", "content"=>"Over the past seven hours the Israeli military has shelled a hospital in Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip where an injured international and Palestinians are trapped inside. I spoke to Swedish national  Fred Ekblad briefly during a 15 minute lull in the fire.  He said the hospital was struck continuously since 7:00 pm this evening. Although Ekblad described his injury as moderate, “I’m bleeding from my head in a few places. The bleeding has almost stopped,” he does have an open wound and is not receiving proper medical care in a facility that is under heavy artillery. When asked why Ekblad wasn’t being treated at the hospital in Beit Hanoun, Israeli activist Neta Golan who has been in touch with the foreign activist said due to the ongoing fire most were taking cover in the building’s corridors, including doctors, taking advantage of what little protection the hallways provided. Golan said the Swedish Embassy and the International Committee for the Red Cross had been notified, yet were not able to secure a medical transport for the young Swede.  Below I’m posting the end of my conversation with Ekblad, before he abruptly ended the call. For the few moments we did speak, I could hear shelling in the background every few seconds, which Ekblad had said was striking the building next to the hospital: I was standing watching TV, my friends were on the news holding a press conference and a shell form the tank hit the building and broke the glass from the window. the glass shattered from the window and I got it on my head, not only glass but concrete. Fuck, that was a direct hit on the hospital. That was a direct hit. I have to go now. The ISM also sent a press release earlier this evening on Elkbad and one other international, Charlie Andreasson who is also trapped in the hospital under fire. The Israeli military has held strong the line that hospitals are human shields employed by Hamas to give cover to rocket launchers. From the ISM “It’s now chaos, the military is shelling directly at us. There are two patients on the second floor and we think they’re okay, but we can’t move them easily as they’re bed-bound. I’m bleeding from a head wound and there’s another person injured. People are very frightened.” Stated Fred Ekblad, Swedish ISM activist. At 19:00, Beit Hanoun Hospital was first hit by an Israeli tank shell and the shooting and shelling has continually increased. This afternoon, Israeli forces destroyed an ambulance in Beit Hanoun, killing one paramedic and critically injuring another. Israeli forces have attacked three Gazan medical facilities and personnel in the last 24 hours. The first resulted in the destruction of Al Durrah Children’s Hospital in Gaza City last night. A two year-old child in the Intensive Care Unit was killed, and 30 others injured. Due to previous shelling nearby, Beit Hanoun hospital has evacuated most of its patients to al-Shifa Hospital. Three patients remain in the hospital. Since Israel began its attack on Gaza, 13 ambulances have been completely destroyed and two paramedics have been killed. Throughout the massacre, medical staff and facilities have been repeatedly targeted. “Israel’s attacks on Gaza hospitals are ongoing, with those in areas by the separation barrier forced to evacuate their patients, paramedics and other rescue workers are doing what they can under conditions of great risk.” Stated Joe Catron, U.S. International Solidarity Movement activist. According to the Gazan Ministry of Health, six out of Gaza’s 13 hospitals have already been severely damaged. One, el-Wafa rehabilitation hospital, has been completely destroyed.  Two medical clinics have been completely destroyed, seven other clinics have been damaged, 13 medical staff members have been injured, and five have been killed. The Ministry of Health in Gaza has demanded, “the immediate cessation of Israeli occupation military attacks against medical facilities and personnel in Gaza, and demands that the international community soundly condemn this latest Israeli atrocity, and hold Israel accountable for these war crimes.”", "score"=>176.49886, "summaryTitle"=>"Breaking: Israel shelling hospital in Beit Hanoun, injured Palestinians and internationals trapped inside", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Over the past seven hours the Israeli military has shelled a hospital in Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip where an injured international and Palestinians are trapped inside.

(AP) — The Kansas Supreme Court on Friday overturned the death sentences of two brothers convicted of killing four friends who were robbed and forced to engage in sex acts before being shot to death and left in a snow-covered Wichita field. The court also struck down three of the four capital murder convictions each against Jonathan and Reginald Carr. It upheld one capital murder conviction for each of them. Prosecutors said the brothers broke into a Wichita home in December 2000 and forced the five people there to have sex with each other and later to withdraw money from ATMs. Two women were raped repeatedly before all five were taken to a soccer field and shot while they were kneeling. Four of them — 29-year-old Aaron Sander, 27-year-old Brad Heyka, 26-year-old Jason Befort and 25-year-old Heather Muller — died. One of the women survived a gunshot wound to the head and she ran naked through the snow to seek help. She became a key witness at the brothers' trial on the capital murder convictions. The killings ended a series of crimes that authorities alleged the Carr brothers committed over nine days in December 2000. Republican Gov. Sam Brownback and several GOP legislators were immediately critical of the decisions, which involved crimes that were among the most notorious in the state since the 1959 slayings of a western Kansas family that inspired the book \"In Cold Blood.\" The legislators said the ruling shows the court's unwillingness to uphold a death sentence, and the governor said he was \"stunned.\" \"They were convicted by a jury of their peers in front of an elected local judge,\" Brownback said in a statement. \"Today's ruling unnecessarily reopens wounds of a tragic moment in Wichita's history.\" Heyka's father, Larry Heyka, also expressed disappointment and said he was struggling to make sense of the rulings, which totaled nearly 480 pages. \"It seems like it takes a lot of time to get through these things, but we will do whatever it takes,\" said Heyka, who is from Council Grove. \"Hopefully going forward, we will all understand what these rulings really mean.\" The Kansas Supreme Court ruled 6-1 in overturning the Carr brothers' death sentences because the presiding judge did not hold separate sentencing proceedings for each man. In overturning most of their capital murder convictions, the majority said the instructions to jurors had been flawed because the judge tied those charges to the rape of the surviving victim, not the deceased ones. The brothers' cases will return to Sedgwick County District Court for further proceedings. The attorneys who represented each brother did not return telephone messages seeking comment. Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett said during a news conference that he's not sure whether his office will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but he promised to continue pursuing death sentences. Jonathan Carr, now 34, and Reginald Carr, 36, were in their early 20s when the crimes occurred. Together, they were convicted of 93 counts, including rape, aggravated kidnapping and aggravated robbery and sentenced to death. The Supreme Court upheld a total of 57 convictions against them. Most of the overturned convictions involved the allegations of forcing their victims to engage in sex acts. Five other convicted killers remain on death row in Kansas. The state Supreme Court last week overturned the death sentence of Sidney Gleason in the killings of a Great Bend couple in 2004. Last year it ordered a new trial for Scott Cheever in the shooting of the Greenwood County sheriff in 2005, though the U.S. Supreme Court later ordered the Kansas court to reconsider. Kansas' last executed someone in 1965, by hanging. The current capital punishment law was enacted in 1994, but the state's highest court has yet to approve any death sentences. ___ Online: Opinions in Reginald Carr's case: http://bit.ly/1rFwzDa Opinions in Jonathan Carr's case: http://bit.ly/1kfhTbv", "score"=>176.26877, "summaryTitle"=>"Kansas court overturns brothers' death sentences", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"TOPEKA, Kan.

Rumors started swirling today that Oklahoma freshman running back Joe Mixon punched a female in the face last night. The incident occurred inside Pickleman's Gourmet Cafe at approximately 2:30am. An employee of Picklman's, that spoke under the condition of anonymity, witnessed the attack. The employee stated that Joe Mixon punched the victim in the face. \"She was knocked out and blood was all over the floor.\" Due to the severity of the attack the victim, described as a white female with blonde hair, left by ambulance, and was reportedly taken to the hospital. \"Her face was swollen as well\" The Pickleman's employee stated. \"Her teeth weren't aligning and it is possible her jaw and nose were broken\" The employee said they were unsure what lead up to the attack, but says she didn't touch Mixon. There are rumors that the attack may have been provoked. The victim may have been intoxicated, and mouthing off to Mixon. The employee stated that Pickleman's was noisy at the time, but they didn't think an argument took place. \"If they did have an argument, I should have overheard it.\" Ultimately though, the witness was unsure if anything led up to the attack. Police arrived about 10 minutes after the incident took place, but the employee stated Mixon had already left.

White House national security adviser Susan Rice petitioned Speaker of the House John Boehner (R., Ohio) in a letter Friday to completely repeal the war authorization, officially known as the Authorization for Use of Military Force in Iraq, or AUMF. Rice’s letter was sent as Congress just hours before it approved a resolution opposing U.S. military intervention in Iraq, where the terrorist group ISIL claims to have established an Islamic caliphate. “We believe a more appropriate and timely action for Congress to take is the repeal of the outdated 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force in Iraq,” Rice wrote, according to a copy of her letter obtained by the Washington Free Beacon . “With American combat troops having completed their withdrawal from Iraq on December 18, 2011, the Iraq AUMF is no longer used for any U.S. government activities and the administration fully supports its repeal,” Rice wrote. “Such a repeal would go much further in giving the American people confidence that ground forces will not be sent into combat in Iraq.” The repeal would come at a complicated – and some argue dangerous – time in Iraq’s history. ISIL has continued to make military gains as the Iraqi army struggles to combat the terror group’s campaign. ISIL has already moved to impose an extreme form of Islamic law on Iraqi citizens, including ordering all women to wear a face veil and threatening violence for disobedience. The Senate has sought several times in the past years to reconsider the AUMFs pertaining to Iraq and Afghanistan as both wars winded down. Senate Democrats have expressed a willingness to repeal the Iraq AUMF, a move that critics call highly dangerous to the United States’ ongoing fight against terror. A repeal of the war authority could also be a boon for ISIL and would send a clear sign that the United States is not willing to stop the militant group from making gains. There is no strong reason to change the AUMF,” John Yoo, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the Bush administration, told the  Free Beacon earlier this year, when the Senate was considering altering the AUMFs. “Over the last 13 years, all three branches have constructed a common understanding and series of practices around the AUMF in fighting the war on terror.” “You break the dam to some extent if you break the AUMF,” a senior Senate aide also said at the time. Congress should “tread carefully because the war on terror is not over and won’t be soon,” the source said. “You could start us down a path of repeal that you can’t turn back.”", "score"=>175.95898, "summaryTitle"=>"White House Wants Repeal of Iraq War Authorization", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Move could be boon for ISIL terrorism in Iraq", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://freebeacon.com/national-security/white-house-wants-repeal-of-iraq-war-authorization/", "referrer"=>["direct", "t.co", "twitterrific.com", "yoono.com", "tweetlist.com", "facebook.com", "minx.cc"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1rEVe9j", "lastseen"=>"20140726003825", "page"=>"http://freebeacon.com/national-security/white-house-wants-repeal-of-iraq-war-authorization/", "ogtitle"=>"White House Wants Repeal of Iraq War Authorization"}, {"domain"=>"wetpaint.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406317512000", "h2"=>"The Kardashians", "h3"=>["Recommended", "Our Partners", "Watch and Earn", "Hot TV", "Popular", "You Might Like"], "site"=>"www.wetpaint.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004335", "keywords"=>"The Kardashians,The Kardashians,Celebrity,News,Beyonce,Gossip,Reality Gossip,TV Stars,Kanye West,Scott Disick", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335415480", "title"=>"Kim Kardashian Throws Shade at Beyonce and Jay Z on Instagram — What Did She Say? | The Kardashians | Wetpaint", "initial"=>"20140725194512", "summaryText"=>"Kim posted a photo of her hubby sporting a ski mask alongside brother-in-law Scott Disick, who is rocking a charming Fair Isle sweater, to Instagram on Thursday, and it’s clear she gives their outfits high marks. “ #ThrowbackThursday #LastYear #StyleIcons", "content"=>"Kim posted a photo of her hubby sporting a ski mask alongside brother-in-law Scott Disick, who is rocking a charming Fair Isle sweater, to Instagram on Thursday, and it’s clear she gives their outfits high marks. “ #ThrowbackThursday #LastYear #StyleIcons #LordDisick,” Kim captioned the pic.

Joe Hart, James Milner , Jesús Navas and Stevan Jovetic unveiled the club's new away kit in Manhattan's Hudson Mercantile this evening during an intimate gathering with fans and media.   During an on-stage Q&A, the players spoke of their thoughts on the latest kit, as well as their aspirations for the coming season as they look to retain their title as Champions of the Barclays Premier League. The away shirt features a dark blue collar with a lighter blue v-shaped insert, while the body consists of a series of blue bands. These tonal bands are dark blue at the top of the shirt and gradually become lighter travelling to the hem to create a striking modern graphic. In May 1999 Manchester City famously scored two late goals to secure a 2-2 draw against Gillingham in the Second Division Play-Off final at Wembley before winning in a penalty shoot-out and securing promotion back to the First Division. On that day City triumphed wearing an away shirt of dark blue and yellow stripes, and to honour that memorable occasion this season’s away shirt features yellow names and numbers on the back, and the Nike swoosh and sponsor’s name are also in yellow on the front. Inside the back of the neck is a dark blue pennant tab with the bold statement ‘We are City’ in yellow. The new away shorts are dark blue, while the new away socks are also dark blue with a lighter blue at the top, and a wide tonal stripe of chevrons on the back. The new away kit will be available to pre-order from July 25 and to purchase in stores and from  Nike.com  from July 29.  While this new kit features Nike’s signature design details, it also offers players the very latest in performance innovation, kit technology and environmental sustainability. NIKE DRI-FIT TECHNOLOGY Nike Dri-Fit technology draws sweat away from the body to the exterior of the shirts and shorts where it quickly evaporates. This helps players to perform at their absolute best by remaining cooler, drier and more comfortable. The laser-cut ventilation holes and mesh panels featured in key areas of the kit are designed to increase air circulation to the players’ bodies to help regulate their temperatures throughout ninety minutes on the pitch. The kits are made of a new dual-knit fabric consisting of both cotton and recycled polyester, which removes sweat while providing a softer feel and an overall more flattering appearance.   ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Nike continues to place environmental sustainability at the heart of their kits, which are again made from recycled polyester this year. These kits have been created to provide both unrivalled performance benefits and lower environmental impact. The kits are made from recycled plastic water bottles. The shorts are 100 percent recycled polyester; the shirts are 96 percent recycled polyester, while the socks are 78 percent. Each kit is made using an average of 18 recycled plastic bottles, and over the last four years Nike has diverted almost two billion of these bottles from landfills to produce their kits. By using recycled polyester Nike is also reducing the energy consumed in the entire process by up to 30 percent.    A NEW AND UPDATED PERFECT FIT Nike took 3D body scans of many of the world’s leading footballers to create a kit with an updated and perfect new fit. The new fit allows the body to move more naturally within the kit, and so effortlessly improves players’ comfort and performance.  The Nike Elite Match fit sock for 2014 also boasts a sleeker and updated design created especially for football. Nike’s designers spoke to many of today’s elite players to gain an insight in to what they wanted from a sock during a game. There are now strategically cushioned zones to provide comfort and protection around the big toe and the anklebones where the majority of impact occurs, while arch support provides a firm foundation for the foot to prevent any slipping.

Panic sets in. This is followed by frantic activity or total immobility. But there are some people, who seem to navigate this onslaught of trails in a calm and peaceful manner. What is their secret? They know every problem has a solution. When you start from this understanding you are already on your way to dealing with whatever you are facing. Knowing there is a solution means that now you have shifted the focus from a problem to a creative outcome. You are no longer in victim mode, now you are in creator mode. They stay away from the mind circles. Mind circles are those repeated thoughts that keep going round and round in your head. Thoughts like: What am I going to do? Where am I going to go? Why does this happen to me? These thoughts only add more confusion to the situation and keep you trapped in a victim mentality. It is best to take a deep breath and ask yourself, “What is the worst case scenario?” This is a great question because often things are not as bad as they first appear. It will also stops you from repeating hypothetical questions based on imagination. They don’t exaggerate the situation. Our mind loves to take a situation and blow it out of proportion. In a flash, we can go from a simple fender bender to OMG I could have been killed. Look at the situation for what it is, don’t add to it. Stick to the facts. They breath. So simple and so effective at calming us immediately! It is such a natural thing that we forget that we breath. When a situation arises that gets your blood pressure and anxiety levels up, stop what you doing. Take several deep breathes, allow yourself to feel the air entering and leaving your body. This takes the focus off what is happening around you, and gets you centred so that you will think and act with clarity. They break the problem down into pieces. When faced with problems we often get overwhelmed by them because we only see the enormity of the situation. As soon as you can after the initial shock, break the problem down in to manageable parts. Identifying ONE thing you can do right now towards a solution. This will helps you see that there is a solution and that the solution is not as difficult as you thought it might be. They are grateful. This can be very difficult in some situations and you may not feel gratitude for a long time after an incident, but it is very helpful. If you can look at a situation and find one thing, however small, to be grateful for it shifts you out of victim mode. In gratitude you are returning to your place of power and taking control over the situation. The situation is not leading you, you are leading the situation. They accept what is. Ultimately it all comes down to accepting the situation exactly as it is. accepting what has happened, accepting the difficulties it has caused, accepting that you might have to do without something, accepting that it could take time to fix, accepting that you might not be happy about the situation. In accepting the experience for what it is, an experience, you will be stepping way from the drama within the story and be left with the facts. When you are no longer reacting to the drama of the story, the problem tends to become simpler. In most situations our natural instinct is to react. We can react in such a way as to make the situation worse thus adding to the problem or, we can react in a calmer way that seeks to find solutions. The choice is yours.

Personally, I tried to ignore the speculations thinking that no secret agency could ever conduct such an insanely-obvious operation, expecting that the rest of the world is stupid enough to buy it. Boy, was I was wrong! It’s not only that the official MH17 story is filled with gaps, but there are also bizarre accounts and ‘coincidences’ that are impossible to ignore: 1. The alleged MH17 was the same plane model as MH-370 The aircraft allegedly shot down over Shaktarsk is a Boeing 777-200, ID number M9-MRD. The missing MH370 was the same model, 777-200, but with a different ID number M9-MRO. Recent, “near conclusive” evidence reports that MH-370 (M9-MRO) was actually hijacked before it disappeared. This means that the hijackers could have safely landed the plane somewhere else. The US military base Diego Garcia is conveniently located within flying distance of the spot where MH-370 disappeared from the radar. One of the passengers on board MH-370, Phillip Wood, allegedly managed to send a photo from his iPhone, tracing back to the previously mentioned military base. If the US secret services got possession of the MH-370 jet, then it was a child’s play for them to set it up for a false flag operation suiting their needs. After the story of a passenger jet having been shot down by pro-Russian separatists broke loose, Russia lost a lot of credibility and support due to the US propaganda machine. 2. The crashed plane had a different configuration of windows than MH17 Unfortunately for those who staged the false flag event, the MH17 plane had an extra window (bellow) next to the second right-side door, which MH370 did not — and neither did the wreckage of the airplane! Update [07.25.14]: Jim Stone brings more photographic evidence supporting the connection between the wreckage and flight MH-370: According to independent journalist Jim Stone, “It is important to note that MH370 [bellow] was new, and therefore never repainted. This is the way the flag ALWAYS looked on Flight 370, and it forever pegs the shoot down plane as flight 370.” “Next is flight MH17. Notice the flag position, and ALSO, that MH17 has an extra window on this side of the aircraft, TOTALLY BUSTING THE OFFICIAL STORY.” [1] So, what does it all mean? The plane wreckage shown in the propaganda pictures doesn’t have the window configuration of MH17, whilst it matches the one of MH370. The conclusion is obvious: the wreckage belongs to the ‘lost’ flight MH370. 3. Rebel leader describes the MH17 victims: rotten corpses, drained of blood “A top pro-Russia rebel commander in eastern Ukraine has given a bizarre version of events surrounding the Malaysian jetliner crash — suggesting many of the victims may have died days before the plane took off. (…) [People at the crash site]: ‘A significant number of the bodies weren’t fresh,’ adding that he was told they were drained of blood and reeked of decomposition.” [2] According to independent journalist Jim Stone: “It is being said that a Dutch doctor who was at the scene within a day has released testimony that the bodies on the plane were rotten and dead days before the crash, which would corroborate what the military commander said and that evidence is there that they were also tortured before the crash. However, the translation from Dutch is very poor and I am working on secondary confirmation.” This means that the bodies found at the crash site in Ukraine are probably the passengers of MH370. 4. ALL the videos were created before MH17 was allegedly shot down “A look at the time stamps for the nine versions of the video that allegedly shows a conversation between Ukrainian anti-fascists and the Russian military and uploaded to what is said to be the Ukrainian Security Service (SSU) youtube account, indicating that all the videos were created before MH17 wrecked in the afternoon 2014-07-1.” [3] Remarkable unit with timestamps confirmed by the date stamp for when the videos were uploaded to a local server contained herein . 5. MH-17 propaganda picture doesn’t match the facts According to the Daily Mail , Flight MH-17 was photographed by one of the passengers just before boarding, but the identification number doesn’t match! MH-17′s ID number is 9M-MRD ( Wikipedia ): The ID of the plane in the propaganda picture is 9M-MRC ( Daily Mail ): 6. Flight MH17 was cancelled, according to flight radar screen Flight Radar-24 screen capture on the day following the crash (7/18) shows MH-17, (9M-MRD) as “canceled” on the date of the crash (7/17): [4] 7. Invalid and pristine passports at the crash site All the passports appearing in the propaganda video are in mint condition. They want us to believe that ALL passports have escaped undamaged after an airplane filled with fuel was shot down by a SAM missile — not to mention the 33,000 feet drop. And that’s not all! Many of presented passports are clearly invalid: some have been ‘hole-punched’ in the upper left-hand corner, while others have been ‘clipped’ (triangular cut-out from right-hand center front cover) – making it impossible that any of these decommissioned passports could be used to travel internationally at the flight’s port of Departure in Amsterdam. [5] 8. U.S. State Department Deputy admits: MH17 ‘evidence’ is based on YT clips & social media posts In a testy exchange between AP reporter Matt Lee and U.S. State Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf, Lee virtually corners Harf into admitting that the “evidence” presented by the U.S. to blame Russian-backed rebels for the shoot down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 [now exposed as MH370] amounts to nothing more than YouTube videos and social media posts. [6] 9. Award-winning reporter blows whistle: U.S. satellite images show Ukrainian troops shooting down the plane that was presented to us as MH17 Award winning former Associated Press reporter Robert Parry has been told by an intelligence source that the United States is in possession of satellite imagery which shows that Ukrainian troops were responsible for the shoot down of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 [now exposed as MH370]. “What I’ve been told by one source, who has provided accurate information on similar matters in the past, is that U.S. intelligence agencies do have detailed satellite images of the likely missile battery that launched the fateful missile, but the battery appears to have been under the control of Ukrainian government troops dressed in what look like Ukrainian uniforms.” [7] References: [1] Jim Stone [2] Yahoo!

According to Jenson Button, updates to the MP4-29 at Hockenheim should work even better here in Budapest, and could even give them shot at taking on Williams, whose FW36 is not expected to be so well suited to the tight and twisting Hungaroring. Button chatted about this and more following Friday practice in Hungary Q: Jenson, the obligatory question: what place does the Hungarian Grand Prix hold in your heart? Jenson Button: This race is still very close to my heart. (laughs) It was my first victory here and every driver will tell you that his first victory is something that will always linger fondly in his memory. It is the fulfilment of a dream that you have when you\u0092re growing up. Then my 200th Grand Prix happened here - and I was also able to win, this time for McLaren - so yes, you can say that this track is very dear to me. It has treated me very nicely in important moments. Q: It\u0092s mid season, it probably hasn\u0092t gone as well as you had hoped, but if you were to rate yourself, are you happy with your performance? JB: I would give myself 10 out of 10! (laughs) You have to have confidence in your ability, so in terms of working with the team this year and developing the car and finding a direction, I am very happy with what I\u0092ve done. I had some fun at some of the races - like in Melbourne, coming through - or in Silverstone: that too was a race I very much enjoyed. And that is important for me. Q: There have been some situations for you this season that can only explained by bad luck. Is that is part of your considerations? JB: I don\u0092t really think about things that I can\u0092t control. There are so many variables - and sometimes these go to your advantage and sometimes not. That\u0092s Formula One. Q: There are some drivers out there who could focus on a McLaren cockpit in the future - or two to be more precise: there is a rumour out there that Alonso and Vettel have been approached - and we heard quite some time ago that McLaren would not have an issue taking Alonso back. What is your feeling about all that? JB: I do feel very much part of this team. I have worked with them for many years. For me I don\u0092t understand why Sebastian should want to leave Red Bull - and Fernando has a long-term contract with Ferrari so I don\u0092t see that. But true, that\u0092s good rumour! Q: The FIA is now handing out fewer penalties in a race. Has the last race been harder - we\u0092ve seen lots of \u0091hard\u0092 overtaking and wheel banging? JB: No, not harder races. As drivers we know our limits. We all know pretty well how far you can push it. So no issues at all. Q: Obviously Felipe Massa has complained about some of the young drivers. Do you agree with him? JB: No. Q: When you look back to the German Grand Prix one week ago, was it a mistake that you were called in on lap 31 for the second time? Was that too early? JB: After every race we go through the race and the strategy we\u0092ve been running - and yes, we realized that this manoeuvre was a mistake. But as long as we learn from it and make sure that we don\u0092t make the same mistake again, then it\u0092s fine. Q: So it was too early, is that what you\u0092re saying? JB: Yes, it was too early - or we should have pitted earlier again with the next stop. But a Grand Prix is a moving target and it\u0092s not always easy to see the right from the wrong. We are usually good at understanding these things - only at that race we got it wrong a bit. Q: McLaren brought updates to Hockenheim - did they deliver? And will they also work here? JB: It was definitely a move forward and it should also help us here. Actually it should benefit us here more than in Germany as it is more of a high-downforce package. And in some ways it did - on the soft tyres and high fuel. Where I see a bit of an issue is the balance of the car over a single fast lap - we have to put our heads together tonight and see what solution we can come up with for tomorrow\u0092s qualifying. When I look at the time sheet I find it impossible to say where we stand. We are sure not up to the speed of the Mercedes and Red Bull, but from today\u0092s experience we should be in the range of the Williams - and they had a podium in Germany. Q: Does that mean that we could see another \u0091Button surprise\u0092 here? JB: Hardly. Because the updates didn\u0092t translate into a seven or eight-tenth step. So no. The Mercedes are still way ahead and so are the Red Bulls. Ferrari and Williams are difficult to judge but my guess is no podium here. Not this time.

LTE throttling on Verizon will begin on October 1st, according to GigaOm . In crowded areas like cities, Verizon will start prioritizing service towards customers on tiered plans. Verizon says that only the top 5% of its customers on unlimited plans will be affected by the change. The policy will be applied to those who have not renewed their two-year carrier contract, and throttling will be based on your activity per billing period.

But There Are 3 Problems With It. Kristen Bell, the voice of Princess Anna in the blockbuster Disney hit ‘Frozen’ and dozens of other films, put on a different costume this week to talk about something you wouldn’t expect. Fans of the humor website Funny or Die were surprised to find a new video of Bell portraying Mary Poppins, the famous fictional British governess. In the video, she is telling her two young wards that she has to quit. Why? She makes minimum wage, and it’s not enough to live on. “Just a three dollar increase can make a living wage,” she sings to the children. She goes onto use all of Mary Poppins’ tricks and tools–little birds, penguins, and so on–to explain how low wages hurt families, businesses, and consumers alike. Don’t get us wrong: We love this video, and anything that brings this issue to a broader audience helps in our campaign for fair wages. But unfortunately, Minimum Wage Mary Poppins is not quite accurate when she says an increase to $10.10, as proposed by Democrats and blocked by Republicans in the Senate earlier this year, would constitute a living wage for most Americans: $10.10 doesn’t keep up with cost of goods.   According to the Economic Policy Institute, increasing the federal minimum wage to $10.10 would lift millions out of poverty, but it would still not reach level it would be if the minimum wage had kept up with inflation since 1968, and would not come close what the minimum wage would be if it had increased with worker productivity. For most Americans, $10.10 doesn’t keep up with the cost of living. While the cost of living varies depending on where you live, $10.10 an hour doesn’t constitute a “living wage” in most areas, particularly if you have one or more dependents. For example, according to the MIT Living Wage Calculator, a single adult can survive in Arkansas on $7.86 an hour, which is still higher than the current minimum wage in Arkansas, $7.25. However, add a kid into the mix, and that shoots up to $16.37. In a more expensive area like the District of Columbia, a single adult needs a living wage of $13.65, which nearly doubles with the addition of one child. All this assumes a 40 hour work week.  Think those numbers from MIT look bleak? Well, they are actually extremely optimistic, because they assume the adults in question are working 2,080 hours a year, or 40 hours a week for 52 weeks. First off, no one should have to work 8 hours a day every single day of the year with no days off. Not only is that inhumane, it ignores events like sickness, family emergencies, and any other of the infinite problems that might keep someone from their 8-hour work day Second of all, and perhaps less obvious, is that the majority of low-wage workers aren’t getting scheduled for  close to 40 hours a week. Not in their dreams. We talk to hundreds of people every night, many of them retail and service workers, and a consistent theme we hear is that schedules are erratic, unpredictable, and insufficient. Sometimes it’s because managers don’t want workers to exceed the number of hours that would require them to provide health care. Sometimes it’s an issue of favoritism or retaliation, where a manager will assign a better or worse schedule based on how they feel about an employee. And if you take a second part-time job, you have no assurance that the two schedules will line up, or that you’d be able to juggle the demands of two jobs as they constantly change. Lastly, thank you Kristen Bell. Despite these few omissions, your collaboration with Funny or Die is hilarious, clever, and shines a bright spotlight on an issue that’s too often overlooked. For the first time in forever, we have a Disney song that helps the economic facts go down.

Tony Strudwick has hailed the importance of the data available to the Reds in their bid to ensure players are in prime condition for every match. Data and analytics is one of Aon’s six core competencies and Strudwick works closely with the club’s principal partner to make the best use of available insight to manage the fitness and health of every squad member. The Aon Training Complex is a hub for Manchester United’s data capture and analysis, and enables their talent to fulfill their potential. Both organizations invest in the best technology available, and have experts in place, such as Strudwick, to take advantage of this information. It is what sets them apart and empowers them to deliver great performance on and off the pitch. “In years gone by decisions about when to rest or play a player probably had much more of an intuitive feel and relied on conventional wisdom. I’m not saying that isn’t still important. But data and analytics can assist us in our decision-making process and help us make more informed judgments,” Strudwick explains. “On one hand what we try to do is push the boundaries of human performance – some of the physical exertions of the players in the home game against Arsenal back in November [2013] for example was incredible, and we have to keep pushing those boundaries. The flip side is that the more you push the players, the greater the risk of them breaking down. We can’t always play it safe, but we have to manage and try to mitigate that risk. The insight we derive from the data we have available helps us do that. “That’s the science side, but the art is about making the right decision at the right time. Sometimes you should ignore the numbers when you feel that’s the right thing to do and other times you take heed of them. That’s what we’re learning, not just us at Manchester United but worldwide. I think practitioners are learning how to assimilate that information in terms of when it tells you the red flag has come up and allow to work out what you can and can’t ignore and what the best strategy is to put in place. “There is an amazing stat that 90% of the data available in the world today has been generated in the last two years. I would guess that 90% of our data on our players has probably been generated in the last two or three years so we are moving towards that period of ‘big data’ as they call it. I think it’s very important that we as a club are at the forefront of that movement and Aon can help us realise that potential through the expertise and innovations that they have. The fact we can tap into that expertise is very exciting.” Stephen Cross, chairman of Aon Global Risk Consulting, said, “Manchester United are pioneers of data and analytics in football. They are leaders in their approach to collecting data and their technical coaching team ensures no stone is left unturned in their quest for peak performance. “To evolve faster than our clients on their risk and people challenges, Aon builds proprietary analytical tools such as Aon GRIP (Global Risk Insight Platform) and catastrophe modeling that turn information into insights for clients. These capabilities enable us to understand risk better than anyone else. We supplement this information with client insights and an incredible analytics team that creates models and collects data to understand what risks are around the corner.” The best predictors of the future are the details of the past. By amassing data and gleaming intelligence from the analysis, the best decisions can be made. From making smart choices to scout for talent and protect investments – uncovering every detail to discover and act on valuable insights – both Aon and Manchester United’s technical expertise consistently delivers performance to surpass competitors. With best-in-class data and analytics, Aon’s ability to extract insights allows organizations to identify and act on smart decisions to protect talent and manage risk.

This Hercules doesn't work alone; he's accompanied by a band of five companions. He's finished his infamous 12 Labors, and he's now become a mercenary taking gold for jobs. But, there's still room in his heart to be a good man once more. Played by Dwayne Johnson, a.k.a. The Rock, this Hercules is haunted by a grievous event in his past. He has to overcome that in order to help end a civil war in Thrace. Amphiaraus (Ian McShane), Autolycus (Rufus Sewell), Tydeus (Aksel Hennie), Atalanta (Ingrid Bolso Berdal), and Iolaus (Reece Ritchie) stand by his side for better or worse. The film directed by Brett Ratner walks the line between the legend and the man. It explores whether a single person could do all that Hercules has supposedly done or whether there have been exaggerations along the way. The story was adapted from the Radical Comics' title by Steve Moore and while it diverges into new territory, the core of the story matches the comic - but the film is bigger and more intense. Thrace is a grand world, and there are plenty of big set-pieces to keep your eyes engaged. Many of the sets are practical, and it definitely makes a difference in how much you become immersed in the film. Everything from the statues to the weaponry to the fight scenes feels gigantic, and since this is a movie about a legendary hero, it's appropriate. In other settings and scripts, some of the action-packed occurrences would ring as over the top and borderline ridiculous, but they've set the right tone here to make those scenes enjoyable. Some modern language is worked into the script, and at times, it feels a little like A Knight's Tale. That's a compliment. Hercules even has his own Geoffrey Chaucer in Iolaus. The character tells tales about Hercules' deeds wherever they go and always adds some extra color to make Hercules appear larger than life. The humor in the movie adds to the A Knight's Tale vibe. There is also a fair amount of violence and blood, some heart-wrenching moments, but more laugh out loud dialogue than you would expect. The source of more than a few of the quips is the companions, especially Amphiaraus and Autolycus. McShane in particular is quirky and hilarious. Though the companions all have screen time in the course of the film, they're mostly one-dimensional. There are five of them, so delving into deep backstories would make the film longer, but their presence would feel more meaningful if we saw why they're fighting beside Hercules. It's explained for a few of them, and we do learn a bit about Tydeus’ and Amphiaraus’ past but it's not enough. There was an opportunity to make them more well-rounded and make the audience care more for them that wasn't quite fulfilled. They all have impressive fighting skills - that much was made crystal clear. They are strong enough to take down warriors many times their numbers, and they're well-suited to train the Thracian army. Atalanta is especially formidable with a bow and arrow, but the fact that the only female fighter in the film wears impractical armor that bares her midriff seemed goofy, particularly when the strength of the armor is demonstrated. Everyone should be covered from head to toe in it. There is no doubt Dwayne Johnson embodies the physicality of Hercules. He went through intense training for the role, and every weight lifted and protein shake ingested was worth it. Having him look like a legend sells all of his incredible feats. Who wouldn't hire this man to fight for them, and who wouldn't believe he took down a hydra and the Nemean Lion? Hercules fights with a club, and it may as well be an extension of Johnson's body. Beyond looking the part, Johnson carries the burdens of the character's past with visible weight. It's easy to see Hercules feels a little lost and aimless until he makes a decision to change his fate. John Hurt appears as the flip-flopping Lord Cotys, and as usual, the actor makes an impression. He does his best with the material, and Cotys does have his moments, but he comes across as non-threatening and silly when he needs to be terrifying. Rebecca Ferguson, though, is enchanting as his daughter Ergenia. For the most part, the plot flows smoothly as Hercules and his friends whip the Thracian army into fighting form in order to end the civil war. Epic action is king, and it can be distracting on occasion. A stronger balance between battles and story would be an improvement, but Hercules is enjoyable nonetheless.", "score"=>174.30458, "summaryTitle"=>"Hercules Review", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Hercules delivers epic battles, heroics, and fun for an enjoyable ride that shows a different side of the legend.", "cities"=>["us", "gb", "ca"], "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/25/hercules-review", "referrer"=>["linkbucks.com", "direct", "t.co", "twitterrific.com", "scribblelive.com", "ign.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1jZZmQa", "lastseen"=>"20140726004331", "page"=>"http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/25/hercules-review", "ogtitle"=>"Hercules Review - IGN"}, {"domain"=>"mashable.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406327451000", "h2"=>["US & World", "More in US & World"], "site"=>"mashable.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004353", "keywords"=>"russia, uncategorized, us-world, world, ukraine, mh17, malaysia-airlines-flight-17", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335433430", "title"=>"Threat of War With Russia Darkens Ukraine", "initial"=>"20140725223051", "summaryText"=>" also taken over after local police quit <B>en</B> masse.

Image: Brendan Hoffman/Getty Images By Amanda Wills 2014-07-25 22:25:38 UTC Russia is intensifying its military action near the border with Ukraine , slowly but steadily amassing troops along boundary lines. Powerful rocket systems from Russia are being moved closer to the Ukrainian border and the Pentagon says the arrival of those heavy artillery systems in the country is now \"imminent.\" The weapons systems could be in separatists' hands as early as Friday, said Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren. \"It's that close,\" Warren said. Though Warren didn't have an exact timeline, he said the U.S. has new evidence that Russia intends to deliver more — and more powerful — rocket launchers to the rebel militias, who Western intelligence officials say are responsible for downing Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 . Although eastern Ukraine for months has been a bloody battleground between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces, the tension has radically increased since MH17 was shot down. A woman stands next to her bicycle as she watches a convoy of Ukrainian armored personnel carriers (APC) riding through the eastern Ukrainian city of Konstantinovka, in the Donetsk region, on July 21, 2014. Image: GENYA SAVILOV/AFP/Getty Images Over the past few days, both Ukraine and Russia have reported increased cross-border attacks, though Warren said on Friday that the U.S. has seen no indications of Ukraine firing back into Russia. \"For the last several days Russian forces using Russian artillery from Russian soil have conducted attacks against Ukrainian military positions in Ukraine,\" said Warren. \"This is unquestionably an escalation from a military perspective.\" The separatists are now behaving as if backed into a corner. They are extremely jittery and testy, especially with journalists, said Mashable 's Christopher Miller, who is currently in Donetsk. Fighting is escalating and, unlike earlier clashes, it's no longer contained to the rural outskirts of the eastern regions but spreading into the cities and residential areas. And consequently, civilian deaths are rising. The movements of rebels within the city is more visible than ever. Convoys of armored vehicles have been cruising through the streets multiple times a day in the rebel-controlled eastern city of Donetsk, which is just 40 miles from the MH17 crash site. The rebels in Donetsk have also taken over after local police quit en masse. Their patrol cars are now painted the red, black and blue separatist colors. Even as reporters were just arriving at the crash site of Flight 17, another battle ignited near the train station in Donetsk, and at least three civilians were killed in the crossfire. The residents, who have lived among warfare for months, finally fled the city. Donetsk is now a ghost town. Earlier this week, pro-Russian rebels, who have shot down a dozen military aircraft over the past few months, downed two Ukrainian military jets near the Malaysia plane crash site. Senior U.S. intelligence officials said this week they have no evidence that directly linked Russia to the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. But they believe Russian-backed separatists likely shot it down. Officials also said they are certain that Russia is responsible for \"creating the conditions\" that led to the tragedy, referring to Russia's support of the separatists. Though Russian troops have assembled along the border with Ukraine several times this year , Warren said there are now close to 12,000 Russian troops on Ukraine's border. As a result, the White House is now discussing more economic sanctions against Russia, specifically aimed at President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, according to press secretary Josh Earnest. \"It only underscores the concerns that the U.S. and the international community has about Russian behavior and the need for the Putin regime to change their strategy,\" Earnest said. The U.S., however, has been hitting Russia with several rounds of sanctions ever since masked Russian gunmen began popping up in Crimea, a peninsula in southern Ukraine. Despite the threat of an economic toll on Russia's economy, Putin still pressed on with annexing Crimea . Christopher Miller contributed to this report from Donetsk, Ukraine.

We are well underway into another TWISTED summer!  Dan started this blog series off last week , and this week I will be recapping the week’s events.  However unlike Dan, I will not be speaking from any kind of coaching/strategic/winners point of view.  Rather, I will be bringing you my two-time loser perspective, which is altogether still useful for noting who is a creep and who is an idiot. Last week ended with the cliffhanger HOH comp involving hell and eggs.  Many lackluster puns later, we find Cody and Frankie to be the victors.  Seems we are in for another week of the larger side of the house (ex-bomb squad) attacking the other side. BUT FIRST, the love triangle between Caleb , Amber , and Cody COULD heat up this week and throw an unexpected wrench into the plan.  This brings us back to noting the creep.  As we previously saw, Caleb has an unhealthy obsession with Amber and seemingly believes in his own mind that they are exclusively \"dating,\" maybe/probably betrothed.  I sense he is asking for permission to contact her father in the DR for confirmation.  Meanwhile Amber wants as little to do with Caleb as possible, without having to face the wrath his rejection will certainly bring upon her.  So she flirts with Cody when she gets the chance, then coddles Caleb when she needs to, just before he loses it and unleashes on them with his plastic sword.  We see Amber and Cody complain to each other that their giggles and cuddles are so closely scrutinized, and they can't even be friends that snuggle and give massages.  This leads us all to wonder if Cody will nominate Caleb so that they may live/love/massage in peace. I feel it is important to mention the super creepy head scarf (which is Amber's actual scarf) that Caleb chooses to wear when in his \"beast mode cowboy\" persona.  This has absolutely no relevance to the game whatsoever, but it is relevant to his overall creeper/obsession value.  If you need more evidence, look no further than the way he cradles the sock monkey while voting in Thursday's episode.  The old bomb squad alliance is now over, but 5 remaining members decide to continue to work together.  They are Cody, Frankie, Zach , Christine , and Derrick .  Christine happened to be in the room, but that's the extent of her involvement in any alliance activity whatsoever. They collectively decide the Caleb/Amber situation is toxic and leave them out of the new alliance, deemed \"The Detonators.\" Cody predictably nominates Brittany and Victoria, and Frankie nominates Amber and Jocasta. Everyone hugs, cries a little, and says how sorry they are, and repeats that they HOPE the nominees will win the Battle of the Block.  The usual. Then we see a short chat between the girls about how they are being picked off and need to do something about it!!! Most likely that was the last we will ever hear of it. In the Battle of the Block competition, the nominees play a sort of chess game, but none of these women know how to play chess, so let's just say they move in an \"L shape\" sequence. Amber ultimately wins for herself and Jocasta .  We see Jocasta have some sort of seizure which goes entirely unexplained, but we can only assume based on the noises and jaw spasticity that it was a serious matter.  Nobody reacts at all (??? cue the \"WTF\" eyes), and we move on.  With a dethroned Frankie, Cody is now the sole HOH for the week.  Veto players are chosen, adding Nicole, Zach, and Caleb to the pool alongside the HOH and nominees. The veto competition is a soccer themed prize/punishment competition.  In the end Caleb COULD choose the Veto, but instead goes for 5k, giving the veto to 2nd place Victoria!  Cody is all upset because his hands are oh so bloody, as we continue to hear, and now his bloody hands are about to have to get bloodier.  Bloodiest bloodbath hands of all time.  After all, nominating 3 people he is in no way aligned with.... tough stuff.   OR will Cody seize the opportunity to nominate Caleb, who not only infringes on his flirtmance with Amber but also went for 5k over the veto causing MORE BLOOD ON HIS HANDS?!  No.  In a completely boring and predictable move, he takes the easy way out and nominates everyone's favorite Donny, in an effort to secure Brittany's eviction.  I see both sides here.  Yes, this was a good opportunity to get rid of Caleb, however, Caleb has made himself quite the target in the house and is good to keep around.  So is Cody the idiot or not?  You choose. We see Frankie get word from his family that his grandfather has passed .  This is really tough to watch.  The Big Brother house is centered around isolation, which would make devastating news like that even tougher to get.  It was nice to see the whole house rally around him with support and I think it is really touching that his grandfather wanted him to continue on in the game. Brittany goes home on a unanimous vote and we are left wondering what might have been.  I am actually sad to see Brittany go, because I feel she was one of the only females with her head truly in the game.  She had a good read of the house and was a competitor.  I think she earned a ton of respect completing her 2400 goal punishment! I personally think that is the most difficult punishment I have seen anyone endure on the show (in fairness, I eliminated myself and the ultimate punishment of being chained to my Neanderthal nemesis from the list of contenders).  I loved seeing her reunite with her adorable kids, and finally we confirm that topknot addiction can be genetic.  I was really hoping to see an HOH win from anyone not in the Detonators alliance, however, Zach and Frankie win the HOH comp.  Perhaps they will surprise us and the long anticipated shakeup will finally come this week!  In any event, we will get to see a lot of Zach, which is fun, like watching a teenaged boy who has had his first energy drink.  I hope to see a lot of hand-to-elbow slapping and fidgeting and hear a lot of crude off-the-wall commentary.  Don't disappoint us Zach! It’s been fun!

It is rare to pick up the morning newspaper and be smacked in the face with a story so surprising that you stand there for a second just to take it in. Wednesday’s news that Broncos owner Pat Bowlen was relinquishing day-to-day management of the team was just such a story. I thought I’d share a glimpse with you about how the super scoop came about. Back in 2009, when columnist Woody Paige interviewed Bowlen and the owner revealed he was having trouble remembering the two Super Bowl victories , we knew something was up. Over the ensuing years reporters here asked questions about what was happening with the owner. We were repeatedly rebuffed. Our questions intensified as Bowlen missed meetings or didn’t show up where he was expected. When reporters encountered him, the lovable owner seemed different and sometimes more distant. People in the organization privately acknowledged that Bowlen was ill, but insisted it was up to Bowlen and his family to reveal what was going on and implored us to respect his privacy. A couple of years ago, as Bowlen’s condition was becoming more evident, we had a high level discussion about the family’s request. I agreed with those who said we needed to respect Bowlen’s privacy. After all, how is it in the public’s interest to reveal that someone is sick before that person wants to share such personal information? No matter what happened, we decided, we would respect his privacy. If someone else wanted to jump the gun, that would be on them. But Post reporters asked questions from time about when the Broncos would tell the world what many around the team knew privately: Mr. B was slipping away. I don’t want to get into exactly what the trigger was for the team to reveal his condition and the change of management. But I believe that the respect The Post showed for Bowlen’s privacy helped the family decide to release the information to The Post exclusively. That the information remained exclusive for more than half a day is shocking in the era of the 24/7 news cycle. The Broncos obviously wanted the news broken in the newspaper — and not online — and despite our transition to a minute-by-minute news cycle, we know how to protect an exclusive. It is a pretty remarkable thing that we were able to do so. I was a nervous wreck for most of Tuesday trying to stop us from doing everything that has become second nature today: no tweeting, no Facebook posts, no telling friends and family what we have, no sending out digests of tomorrow’s newspaper or screenshots of the developing front page. Still, I worried someone in the organization wouldn’t get the message and I knew people were buzzing about what the big story was for Wednesday’s newspaper. In the end, I was prepared for the scoop not holding up until Wednesday morning’s newspaper. After all, we don’t think that way anymore. (And if you were awake at 2 a.m. Wednesday, you would have seen it on denverpost.com .) Nowadays we get a tip and at most we think we might have it alone for an hour. We are used to posting stories online as soon as we confirm them, to use social media to gain the widest audience. We no longer think the starting pistol fires when the newspaper publishes a story. The pistol fires soon after the tip comes in. Publish it or someone else gets it first. Game on. I don’t know this for sure, but I think the Broncos, in addition to wanting to reward the Post for its determination and discretion, also wanted to control the news cycle. And that is OK. Rather than have that story break at 10 p.m. Tuesday night and by the next morning the story would be focused on what this meant for the Broncos, the team wanted the moment frozen in time. I can imagine they wanted to memorialize in the newspaper the transition itself and not have the morning newspaper be a second day story about people’s reaction to the news. Bronco fans and the general public should be as shocked as they were about Bowlen’s exit. And that’s what happened. Bam! Mike Klis, who broke the story, sent me an email Wednesday morning that said in part: “I love driveway scoops.” I do too. But I can’t remember the last time that happened. I bet you can’t either. Just goes to show the power of the printed newspaper.

The comedian’s latest album Mandatory Fun —his fourteenth traditional studio record—has just been announced as the new number one album in the country for the week ending July 20. Billboard confirmed the good news earlier today after a week or so of speculation about who would claim the top spot. The album, his last with RCA Records according to his current contract, managed to sell 104,000 copies—much higher than industry forecasters originally guessed. Going into the week of the release, Weird Al and singer-songwriter Jason Mraz were pitted against one another, with both expected to sell somewhere near 70,000 copies of their new albums. Mraz collects his second consecutive runner-up album with Yes! Shockingly, Mandatory Fun is the first comedy album to reach number one in over five decades, making Weird Al’s triumph that much more special. The last title in the comedy genre to hit the penthouse was Allan Sherman’s My Son, the Nut , which sat in the top spot for eight weeks back in 1963. In addition, Fun also has the largest sales week for a comedy album in twenty years. It misses eclipsing The Beavis & Butt-Head Experience , which moved 118,000 copies in 1994. The surprise success of the new album is attributed to a highly viral and well-publicized collection of music videos the parodist released in the past week. Since last Monday, Yankovic has premiered one new clip every day on well-trafficked sites like Yahoo , Collegehumor , and the Wall Street Journal . Not only was there a new story every day to spread around social media and the blogosphere, but most of them were of songs that either are popular now or have been recently. The twelve track CD is a mixture of traditional parodies and comedic originals in the style of popular bands. Weird Al covers everything from song of the summer “Fancy” by Iggy Azalea to Pharrell’s Oscar-nominated “Happy” to football fight songs and the Foo Fighters. Nothing is off limits to the Grammy winner , though he did go out of his way to secure permission for each and every song. The beloved comedian is known to get the OK  from the original artist before releasing parodies, and this time around they were all too happy to oblige. For example, when Weird Al’s manager didn’t hear back from Pharrell’s team, he took matters into his own hands, emailing the super producer himself. “He couldn’t have been nicer and he said he was honored to have me do the parody.” Al said of their interaction. The same is apparently so for the other artists who agreed to let their songs be included.", "score"=>173.9675, "summaryTitle"=>"For the First Time Since 1963, a Comedy Album is #1", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"After 30 years making people laugh with his parodies, Weird Al Yankovic is finally at the top of his game.

It includes a useful web video <B>search</B> function that gives you...", "content"=>"Scott Adam Gordon 11 minutes ago There are a number of very good Android video players available, with a variety of functions. If you're looking for a better experience than the stock Android video player, here are my top 5... © ANDROIDPIT For the pleasure-seeker: MX Player  MX Player is a master of the Android video player scene - it just works. It plays tons of file types, has subtitle integration, and the best on-screen gesture controls you're likely to find in an Android video player. You can pinch-to-zoom and control the volume and brightness levels just by sliding your finger up and down the screen. You can also intuitively scroll forwards or backwards through the video you are watching. The advertisements are unintrusive - they're only apparent on the pause menu - but the downside of MX Player is that you sometimes may need to manually download codecs for certain videos, which can be annoying.  MX Player's ads are quite small and the overall look of the app is consistent. © ANDROIDPIT / J2 Interactive MX Player INSTALL For the optimist: VLC for Android Beta VLC player has long since been a hit on PC, and for good reason. It has great functionality and an impressive range of features - its one of those video players that can just play anything. VLC integrates similar on-screen controls to MX Player, but it is maybe not quite as smooth. VLC for Android Beta is, naturally, still in its beta stage, meaning it might be more buggy than some of the other video players available, but it also means it’s being updated regularly with an eye on optimization for users, so it might be worth sticking with. Despite VLC's claim that it may kill your cat, we think this is unlikely... © ANDROIDPIT / VideoLabs VLC for Android Beta INSTALL For the paranoid: RealPlayer Cloud RealPlayer Cloud, described on the Play Store as “like Dropbox for videos”, offers a great video suite with online video search and cloud storage. Stepping away from the all-in-one video audio picture viewer RealPlayer once was, RealPlayer Cloud makes use of online storage and cloud syncing, to share videos between multiple devices. It does require you to make an account, which can be a pain for some people (like me), so it’s not as easy to get started with as some other players, but this is of course because of its cloud functionality. RealPlayer Cloud offers 2 GB of cloud storage space when you install it, and has a beautiful interface. It includes a useful web video search function that gives you recommended videos of the day, too. It did take some of the online videos a while to start, but the ability to share clips between devices and upload them to the cloud was great. It’s a fantastic free app. The RealPlayer aesthetic and design is one of the best I've encountered. © ANDROIDPIT / RealNetworks, Inc. RealPlayer Cloud INSTALL For the multi-tasker: MoboPlayer MoboPlayer's interface isn’t all that pretty, but it has some nifty features that make it stand out. Mobo Player supports a \"floating windows\" mode for users who quickly need to shrink their video to access something else on their device. The videos do need to be decoded before you can do this in some cases, but it's a neat feature nonetheless. It also scans your storage folders to find all of your video files when you first load it up. The actual video player itself maybe isn’t quite as nice as some of the others on the list, but it’s strong in other areas, and also contains an online video search feature, which is useful. The initially ugly interface can be customized, too. MoboPlayer make look awful, but it runs smoothly. © ANDROIDPIT / Mobo Team MoboPlayer INSTALL For the modder: BSPlayer  One thing BSPlayer is not, is total BS. BSPlayer comes with a very intuitive interface, making searching for your videos a breeze. It features all of the classic facets of good video players: hardware and software encoding, a huge amount of supported video formats, and built-in subtitle tracks. To add to this there are a number of themes and skins available for customization to spruce it up too. Another handy option is the ability to choose whether playback always begins at the start of your video or the last played part. It's a really nice video player which uses on-screen gestures for navigation - download it if you're interested. BSPlayer has some great customization options, if you're into that type of thing. © ANDROIDPIT / BSPlayer media BSPlayer FREE INSTALL What do you guys think?

Price's arrest means that a federal grand jury has completed its work and returned an indictment against the commissioner. That document remains sealed at this hour, meaning it’s not clear what charges Price faces, or who else may be accused. Later today, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas, which is leading the investigation of Price, is expected to announce the charges. Price was arrested at an office building north of downtown Dallas around 8 a.m.; it's unclear what he was doing there. Three other defendants are expected to be in custody later this morning, sources said. Price and the others are expected to make initial appearances before a federal magistrate judge later this afternoon. Then they are expected to be released pending trial, which may not occur for a year or more. News 8, which has followed the FBI investigation for three years, will have details as soon as they are available. Price is one of the most powerful politicians in North Texas. Since he was first elected in 1984 as Dallas County's first African American commissioner, Price has made a career out of vocal, forceful advocacy of minority issues. He also has close ties to some of Dallas business elite, giving him great power and influence. Known by many of his constituents as \"Our Man Downtown,\" Price resides over District 3, which encompasses West Dallas, downtown, and a wide swath of southeastern Dallas, Hutchins and Seagoville. He's been under FBI scrutiny since at least the summer of 2011. That’s when dozens of agents searched his home and office for evidence of corruption. Agents also searched the homes of Fain and Nealy. During that search, FBI agents seized more than $229,000 in cash along with a collection of expensive watches from a safe in Price’s Oak Cliff home across from Lake Cliff Park. Agents seized an additional $230,000 from a Dallas County builder, who was set to pay that money to Price for the purchase of a then-vacant 9-acre tract of land at 7001 Grady Niblo Road in Dallas. That builder has since taken control of that property and has built an apartment complex on it. In March 2012, federal prosecutors filed a civil forfeiture lawsuit to keep the cash from the safe and the land sale, alleging they were part of an illegal scheme. That forfeiture case was put on hold pending the criminal indictments.

VICE has obtained disclosures that reveal for the first time since this program was made public that FISA Court judges have not only owned Verizon stock in the last year, but that at least one of the judges to sign off on the NSA orders for bulk metadata collection is a proud shareholder of the company complying with these requests.  On May 28 last year, Judge James Zagel, a FISA Court member since 2008,  purchased stock  in Verizon. In June of this year, Zagel  signed off  on a government request to the FISA Court to renew the ongoing metadata collection program. He's not the only one. We filed a request to the courts for the personal finance statements for all of the FISA Court judges. About a month ago, federal judges began turning in their disclosures, which cover the calendar year of 2013. The disclosures show that FISA Court Judge Susan Wright  purchased  Verizon stock valued at $15,000 or less on October 22. FISA Court Judge Dennis Saylor has  owned  Verizon stock, and last year collected a dividend of less than $1,000. The precise amount and value of each investment is unclear—like many government ethics disclosures, including those for federal lawmakers, investments amounts are revealed within certain ranges of value. The FISA Court continually rotates with respect to how it deals with requests from the government. In essence, each judge takes turns overseeing surveillance asks from the Feds. Judge Roger Vinson, the judge who signed off on the order disclosed by Snowden last year, requested an extension for filing his personal finance statement. While it's not clear how the rotation schedule works, it's certainly plausible Judge Saylor or Judge Wright will soon be asked to renew the next request by the NSA for metadata from telecom companies.  Do the investments constitute a conflict of interest? Federal judges are bound by an  ethics law  that requires them to recuse themselves from cases in which they hold a financial stake in the outcome, or in cases in which their \"impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" In the past, revelations about stock ownership have invalidated certain court decisions. For example, after an eye-opening  investigation  from the Center for Public Integrity, which revealed that a federal judge who participated in a mortgage foreclosure-related decision owned stock in Wells Fargo, a case was re-opened. The FISA Court is different. For one thing, FISA proceedings are ex parte , meaning Verizon isn't even a party for the NSA requests. However, telecom companies certainly have a stake in how they comply with government orders, and some ethicists say judges would be well served if they simply steer clear of these types of investments. \"I think prudence would suggest that a FISA judge would not acquire investments in these telecommunication stocks,\" says Professor William G. Ross, an expert on judicial ethics at Samford University's Cumberland School of Law in Alabama. \"I'm not saying there is a conflict of interest, which my impression says there's probably not,\" Ross says, adding, \"this is between what's improper and what's prudent.\" District court clerks told VICE that judges typically do not offer responses on the record for these types of inquiries. Judge Saylor's office could not offer a comment, and a request for comment was also sent to the other judges.  Last year, Gawker  reported  that many FISA Court judges have owned various telecommunication stocks over the years. But the ethics forms we obtained show that since the Snowden revelation, FISA Court judges have been specifically purchasing and holding stock in the company that is the only named telecom giant known for its compliance with the NSA's bulk data orders.

According to Digitimes , Apple will release two versions of the rumored iPhone 6 on separate dates. The new strategy is reportedly being considered because \"Apple does not want to repeat the mistake it made in 2013 when it launched the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C simultaneously,\" the article explains. It's believed that releasing both models on the same day hurt overall sales, particularly those of the iPhone 5C. Tech guru Ben Lovejoy disagrees with that idea, and insists that Apple was unaffected by the way it rolled out its last two iPhones. \"While there is evidence to suggest that the balance of sales between the two handsets differed from Apple’s expectations, the reason appears to be that more people than predicted chose to buy the more expensive model. Hardly a mistake,\" Lovejoy wrote. The iPhone 6 is expected to be available in two sizes, a 4.7-inch model, and a 5.5-inch model, which will be the largest iPhone to date. Until now, it was widely expected that Apple would unveil the new iPhone in early September, with a shipping date schedule for later in the fall. If Digitimes is correct, we may still see an iPhone 6 this autumn, with the second model coming early next year.

Some of the casting is just confirmation of rumors we had already heard. ( Keisha Castle-Hughes as Obara Sand , yay! Recasting princess Myrcella, boo.) But there are also plenty of surprises including Star Trek: Deep Space Nine fan fav Alexander Siddig as Oberyn Martell’s older brother Doran, and, best of all, Jonathan Pryce ( Brazil , The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise) as the High Sparrow. The High Sparrow, for you non-book readers, is the new High Septon (religious leader) at King’s Landing. With Tywin Lannister dead and Tyrion on the run, the powerful High Sparrow is now the character in the best position to bring out Cersei’s sourest expressions. Pryce, who will likely bring a droll passive-agression to the High Sparrow, is certainly the biggest name in the new cast. But it’s always fun to try to spot who will be a favorite in the future. With Pedro Pascal and his character Oberyn Martell out of the picture, newcomer Rosabell Laurenti Sellers as his bastard daughter Tyene Sand, looks to be an early frontrunner for most charismatic new cast member. Who can resist a girl with double daggers? These videos can hold only a vague excitement for non-book readers who don’t know what to expect from the new characters and don’t want to be spoiled by any research. We’ll go a little bit into some spoilery book reader territory below, but the rest of you can rejoice that, with a lot of the action moving to Braavos and Dorne, Game of Thrones has made good on their promise to include more diversity](http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/game-of-thrones-season-five-characters-leaked-diversity) in their cast next year. Are they gone? Good. Well the biggest surprise in this video is certainly the lack of Greyjoys, specifically Theon’s uncles Euron and Victarion. Many of us were already suspicious when Balon Greyjoy hadn’t kicked the bucket by season’s end. Will the Pyke plotline be entirely scrapped? Or postponed until next year? Where is Arianne Martell? Will she be replaced entirely by Myrcella and those three charismatic Sand Snakes? Will the big climatic focus of Season Five be Cersei’s walk of shame? ( Already rumored to have been filmed ?) Or Arya’s transformative moment? We’ll have to wait and see but for now, at least, we can all agree that with Jonathan Pryce as the High Sparrow, things at King’s Landing won’t be nearly as dull as they might have been.

During his first spell with the west Londoners, the 36-year-old, who was signed by Mourinho in his own first stint at the club in 2004, made 226 Barclays Premier League appearances and scored 100 goals. An imposing physical presence with a clinical eye in front of goal Drogba helped Chelsea establish themselves as a major force in English and European club football, winning three Barclays Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups as well as the UEFA Champions League. Indeed, the Ivorian's last act as a Chelsea player was to score the winning penalty in the Champions League final shoot-out against Bayern Munich – a match in which he had also conjured a late equalising header to force extra time.

How many couples are like us? Wei-Hwa, 38, San Jose, California Dear Wei-Hwa, In 1927, the Motion Picture Association of America issued “ The Don’ts and Be Carefuls .” Item No. 19 in the “be careful” section of the list was “man and woman in bed together” — a scene the organization thought could risk “vulgarity and suggestiveness.” Even decades later on TV, Lucy and Ricky were always shown in separate beds in “I Love Lucy” despite being married offscreen, as well as on it. Times have changed. It doesn’t take a data journalist to work out that the chances of you having seen a couple sharing a bed onscreen is high. But the reality of what’s happening offscreen is harder to gauge, tucked away in bedrooms. After all, Wei-Hwa, how many people have you told about your sleeping arrangements? The best existing data comes from the National Sleep Foundation. It found that 23 percent of respondents to its Sleep in America poll who were married or living with someone sleep in a separate bed or on the couch. But it didn’t ask why those couples were sleeping apart or how often they did so. Plus that survey was conducted in 2004, so we thought it was worth getting some new, more detailed data on the topic. Early this month, we asked SurveyMonkey Audience to help us out. It gathered responses from 1,057 American adults who were married, in a domestic partnership, in civil union or cohabiting with a significant other. (Find the  data on our GitHub page .) Almost half of the respondents said they have slept apart from their partner at least once. And some couples are doing that regularly: 14 percent said that when they and their partner are home, they sleep apart every night. I was curious whether those respondents conform to stereotypes; are older, married couples or those who have been together for years the ones most likely to sleep apart? Let’s look at those factors individually. First up, age. Respondents 60 and older were the most likely to sleep apart — 22 percent compared with just 5 percent of respondents 18 to 29. (We’ll get to the possible reasons why later.) Marital status is an altogether different story. Just a few percentage points separate the rate that cohabiting couples and legally partnered couples sleep in separate beds. So, other factors aside, Wei-Hwa, your sleeping arrangement is no less surprising because you mentioned a wife rather than a girlfriend. Finally, how does the number of years spent together affect the chances of sleeping together? Of couples who had been together for five years or less, 9 percent said they slept apart every night, compared with 16 percent of couples who had been together 20 years or more (of course, those results could be a function of age or vice versa). I have no idea how long you and your wife have been together, Wei-Hwa, but it turns out that the “I Love Lucy” setup — two beds, one room – is pretty outdated. Just 12 respondents (3 percent of those who sleep apart) said they share a bedroom but have separate beds. Of the 482 people who specified where they slept when they slept apart, 39 percent said separate bedrooms and 31 percent said the couch were the best way to find some space. It’s worth remembering, though, that those choices are often constrained, a point made by Paul Rosenblatt, a professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota. Wealth and class play a large role in sleeping arrangements, Rosenblatt said. Referring to his research on sleep patterns , Rosenblatt found that “bed sharing challenges are quite different from those of people who can afford a house with several master bedrooms and maybe several wings.” But the question is, why does a couple (or at least one half of it) decide to sleep apart in the first place? We tried to offer people as comprehensive a list of reasons as possible and the option to tick all the boxes that applied to them. Unsurprisingly, high on the list was snoring (checked by 46 percent of those who sleep apart), illness (26 percent) and arguments (15 percent). But while I was thinking about bedroom behavior, Wei-Hwa, I realized how different this response would be if you had posed the question thus: “my wife and I no longer sleep together.” That sex and sleep are used interchangeably is a bizarre euphemism. But the link between sex and sleep may be overstated, according to the co-founders of the Bedtime Network , an online community dedicated to sharing sleeping tips. Cindy Bressler and Lisa Mercurio say that “couples can sometimes achieve a better relationship overall when sleeping is held sacrosanct and sex-time is scheduled and/or prioritized.” We tested that theory by asking respondents whether they agreed with the statement “our sex life has improved as a result of sleeping in separate beds.” Of the 482 who responded, just 5 percent of respondents agreed, and 40 percent said they “strongly disagreed.” That suggests the Bedtime Network might be slightly optimistic about the effects of sleeping apart. If it’s any comfort, Wei-Hwa, those responses are just a result of evolution and social norms. According to Neil Stanley, a doctor who managed a sleep laboratory at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals in England, the link between sex and sleep is a uniquely human trend and a thoroughly modern phenomenon: This sleeping arrangement, caused merely by lack of space, has lead to our idea that sleep, sex and the bedroom are somehow linked. In other animals there is no connection between sleep and sex, they are entirely separate activities carried out at different times and different locations. The reason they became linked in the human mind is that at the same time as we started building ‘bedrooms’ we were also developing our sense of shame/embarrassment. Therefore because sleep and sex were behind the closed bedroom door, as it was the one place the adults could get some privacy, the bedroom became inextricably linked with sleep and sex. So, Wei-Hwa, plenty of other couples, regardless of marital status, have similarly separate sleeping arrangements. As do most couples in the animal kingdom.

Rest assured, an analysis by Consumers’ Checkbook indicates your annual membership fee to Costco, Sam’s Club or BJ’s can be money well spent. However, to maximize your savings, you’ll want to be sure you’re not missing the very best deals. Money Talks News savings expert Stacy Johnson has a list of warehouse best buys in the video below. Take a minute to watch his top picks and then keep reading for more suggestions on how to make the most of your warehouse membership. 1. Alcohol We’re not encouraging overconsumption, but we can’t help but point out that those big bottles of wine at your local warehouse store can be a big bargain. Liquor and beer is typically cheaper than anything you’ll find at your local grocer, too. The best thing about buying alcohol at a warehouse club is you don’t even need a membership in some states. Depending on your state laws, you may be able to walk in and buy discounted libations without paying an annual fee. 2. Prescription drugs and over-the-counter medicines Prescription drugs are another thing you can buy from a warehouse club even if you don’t have a membership. If you need to pay for a prescription out of pocket or have a co-pay based on a percentage of the drug’s price, definitely check your local warehouse club first before heading to the drugstore. You do need a membership for over-the-counter medicines, and these items are often sold at a significant discount, too. However, be realistic about whether you’ll use up your purchase before its expiration date. You’re not saving any money if you end up tossing half the bottle in the trash. 3. Dairy products Among dairy products, milk is probably where you’ll find your biggest bargain. Regular prices can be lower than even the sale prices at the grocery store. Cheese is also usually a good buy, although eggs can be hit or miss. 4. Organic produce I have friends who have Costco memberships specifically for the organic produce. They swear it has the best quality and the lowest price of any store in our metropolitan area. Of course, they have large families and go through a tremendous amount of food each week, too. If you’re single, a couple or a small family, you should have a plan about what to do with bulk produce purchases. These items won’t keep in your fridge for long. You might see about splitting the goods with another family, or another option would be to prep and freeze the extras for future use. 5. Meat Meat is another best buy at warehouse clubs. You may find sale prices at your grocery stores that are comparable to prices at the warehouse club, but the latter seems to stock better quality meats. The more expensive cuts typically garner you the biggest savings. With meat , you don’t need to stress quite as much about buying in bulk. Freezing meat is simple and doesn’t require the same level of prep work you might encounter with produce. Simply break down the bulk package into the desired quantities, wrap in freezer bags (squeeze out the air in the bag before sealing) and you’re done. 6. Electronics There seems to be some debate about the value of buying electronics at the warehouse clubs. While the prices are definitely competitive, you may be able to find cheaper comparable items online or at big-box electronic stores. What gives warehouse products the edge is that they may come with a complimentary in-house warranty that beats anything offered by the manufacturer. However, as always, it’s best to do some shopping around before a major purchase to ensure you’re getting the best deal. 7. Dog and cat food The Kirkland pet food sold at Costco has all the ingredients of a high-end brand but is sold at a fraction of the cost. Kirkland is made by the same company that produces the Diamond brand and, depending on whom you believe, that could be a good thing or bad thing. Meanwhile, you’re likely to find deals on other pet foods at all of the warehouse clubs. People with large dogs will most likely benefit from the big bags sold at these stores. 8. Gasoline Many warehouse clubs have their own gas stations now. While the prices may not warrant a special trip, you should definitely fill up while at the store. Gas at warehouse clubs is generally at least a few cents cheaper than what you’ll find at surrounding stations. 9. Tires Speaking of cars, your warehouse club might also be your best bet for a deal on new tires . The price may be cheaper and the installation practically free. What’s more, your tires can be changed while you shop, making it a convenient way to cross one more thing off your to-do list. 10. Caskets and urns Finally, if you have a Costco membership, head online to check out its selection of caskets and urns. Even with shipping, its prices are much cheaper than practically anything you’d find through your local funeral home. That said, these caskets don’t have  sealing , which may be an important feature for some people. Plus, they all look to be standard size, so if your loved one is big and tall, this option might not work. Those are our top suggestions for warehouse best buys. Do you agree or did we miss anything?

ADVERTISEMENT", "content"=>"The Office of Congressional Ethics has for the first time accused an entity of lobbying Congress illegally. The complaint has been referred to the Justice Department, which enforces the Lobbying Disclosure Act, but few other details are available. ADVERTISEMENT The Office of Congressional Ethics operates mostly in secrecy. It does issue a quarterly report that summarizes the cases it has taken. At the end of the most recent report — which covers April through June — the office noted it had “voted to refer one entity to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia for failure to register under the Lobbying Disclosure Act.” Joshua Ian Rosenstein, a partner at Sandler Reiff Lamb Rosenstein & Birkenstock, said the office must have found significant evidence of wrongdoing in order to make the referral. “Because the [disclosure] law does not require time-sheets or other supporting documentation, one would have to assume that OCE has something pretty substantial to justify them taking the extraordinary step of making a referral.” Meredith McGehee, the policy director at the Campaign Legal Center, told The Hill that this is the first time the office — which typically handles congressional misconduct — has taken such an action. “I'm very pleased to see it. One of the issues in lobbying disclosure is the lack of enforcement,” she said. “It's very clear that the [Lobby Disclosure Act] is seen as a burdensome paper exercise.” The case was first unearthed by Covington & Burling lawyer Robert Kelner, who called the move “a big deal” in a post Friday on his firm’s policy blog. “Until now, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia has focused exclusively — and rarely — on bringing cases against registered lobbyists who fail to timely file reports,” Kelner wrote. Some lobbyists and public interest advocates have criticized the ease with which people can get away with skirting the lobbying registration laws. They blame limited staff and funding at the office within the Justice Department that oversees lobbying reports. The number of registered lobbyists has plummeted since 2009, after President Obama began limiting lobbyists’ access to the White House, and two years after Congress put in place sweeping ethics reforms. In 2007, there were nearly 14,840 registered lobbyists, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. By 2013, that number had dropped to just more than 12,340. A person must register as a lobbyist when they spend more than 20 percent of their time advocating for a client before Congress and certain members of the administration. “There are some cases that are clear as day, where registration should be required.

We learned that sometimes hard work really does pay off, because \"Weird Al\" not only had porn made out of his likeness , but scored the very first No. 1 album of his career with Mandatory Fun . It was, in fact, a porny week overall. Between Nicki's badonk, and Coolio's absorption into the PornHub machine, and the news that Kid Rock has been summoned to court in order to produce a glass dildo . And Beyoncé, in the midst of rumors re: her marriage to Jay Z dissolving , got freaky for 50 Shades of Grey . Meet 50 Shades of Bey, who may or may not still be \"Crazy in Love\": Play Speaking of powerful women with trophy husbands, editor Puja Patel has been playing the Kim Kardashian game and has ascended to D-list celebrity status, \"a major success that only took about five hours of playing over the span of two days.\" She goes on: I'm currently scoring very well on the \"Barfly,\" \"Socialite,\" and \"Dating\" scales in this virtual world, which is exactly opposite to the categories I'm scoring well IRL at the moment (\"Office Drone,\" \"Deep Sigher,\" and \"Internetting\"). Am starting to treat Kim K money like it's real money and was very pleased that my coffee-break Starbucks iced tea cost only $2 today, which is exactly how much money I found in a bush in Kim Kardashian's Hollywood a few minutes earlier. In related news, GQ 's Kim K— er, Kanye West story was great. Turns out just wants to call someone \"Mom\" again. Also, he too has ditched Jay Z to begin his own one-man Watch the Throne for the next single. And he's relapsed, and is a blowfish now. Also, there was Vivian Host's fascinating piece for Red Bull Music Academy about the history of the \"Sing Sing\" break, an absolute staple of Baltimore club music. Here's where is all began: Play New beginnings are a thing too, and with the arrival of \"Inside Out\" (and \"Do You\" in the same day), we learned that Spoon may have the comeback record of the year in They Want My Soul . (Admittedly, there's less competition for that title than last year, what with QOTSA, NIN, JT, and MBV). But seriously, this shit's great: Play The Disco Demolition sequel the world never asked for happened last weekend and nobody actually cared. Pitbull released a new song and people you wouldn't expect — like us , and Vice — did actually care.  But if we're being honest, as much as we loved the headline generated by that story about the George Harrison memorial tree getting eaten by beetles , and marveled over the insights provided by emo-game OG and Jade Tree founder Tim Owens , we're probably proudest to have uncovered the fact that #SadJackWhite's big day at the ballgame was not a one-off event, but more likely evidence that the Third Man Records kingpin is being forced, against his will, to attend MLB events only hours (maybe minutes) before the shows on his current tour.

Specialist Grommet, who tattooed Matty's service number V053 in he dog's ear", "content"=>"FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (WTVD) -- Specialist Brent Grommet is fighting a different kind of battle these days. Back from Afghanistan, he's coping with and recovering from spinal and traumatic brain injuries and PTSD. But it seems his own progress is taking a backseat to another mission. Grommet is trying to get his dog back. The 23-year-old soldier is assigned to the 101st Airborne Division out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, but his focus has been on the Fort Bragg area where he's been told his combat buddy, a young German Shepard named Matty, now lives. The challenge is now to convince Matty's adopted family to return him to the first friend he ever knew. \"They're not dog and handler, they're brothers,\" said Don Grommet, the soldier's father. Specialist Grommet and Matty were paired in the fall of 2012 as a part of the Tactical Explosive Detector Dog program. After graduating from TEDD in November of that year, the pair deployed to Afghanistan where they were injured in two separate IED attacks. When the pair returned from deployment in July of 2013, Matty was whisked away from a New Jersey Air Force Base, and Grommet returned to Ft. Campbell to prepare for medical retirement due to spinal and brain trauma injuries, as well as PTSD. \"When you loose a dog it's really hard, but after you've been through everything with that dog, and you come back and you're told 'Okay, you got ten minutes to say goodbye to your dog and then we're taking him?' It's a very rough place to be left off on,\" said Spc. Grommet. Don Grommet was able to track Matty to Fort Bragg, where Vet Services was treating the K9 for a torn ACL, and preparing him for separation from service and adoption. The Grommets said they submitted and re-submitted adoption paperwork, and were told the first set of documents were lost. \"We were told several times not to worry about it; that everyone knew that Brent was going to adopt Matty\" said Don Grommet. But after months of weekly calls to check on the adoption status, Grommet said his son received a call in March 2014 telling him Matty had been adopted. \"It's not the soldier's fault, and the soldier shouldn't be punished,\" he said \"But the only one being punished here is the soldier and the dog.\" The Grommets said they had a military contact track Matty's adoption to a civilian in the Fort Bragg area. They said they were told the man had strong ties to the TEDD program, and was unwilling to give up Matty because he was too attached after a few weeks. \"I'd be willing to buy the dog off of him, get a new dog for him....Whatever it would take to get Matty back,\" said Specialist Grommet. \"I'd like to think that people will do the right thing when it comes down to it,\" his father said. \"I do have times when I doubt that this is ever going to happen. I know my son has doubts that this is ever going happen.\" \"I probably will not give up on this until the day I die,\" said the father, who has reached out to the White House, Congressmen, and military representatives on this search. Specialist Grommet, who tattooed Matty's service number V053 in he dog's ear, hopes the new owner will have a change of heart when he or his family and friends hear the soldier's plea. \"My son needs that dog for his healing.\" Grommet can be contacted through Facebook at www.facebook.com/brent.grommet?ref=ts.

But the Alberta family is dealing with another challenge: finding accommodations in Toronto while the six-month-old boys undergo chemotherapy at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children. Parents Richard and Leslie Low made an appeal on their blog on Thursday for a reasonably priced condo where the family of six could stay while the boys undergo procedures to treat retinoblastoma -- an eye cancer that's typically found in children under two years old. The family had looked into staying at the Ronald McDonald House, which accommodates families whose children are receiving treatment for serious illnesses. But the facility only offers one bedroom per family. \"We know this blog has viewers from all over the world. Does anybody have a condo in Toronto that they lease for 6 months' time??? Or even better, does anybody know the Marriott family?\" the family  wrote on their blog . The Lows recently booked a 10-day hotel stay downtown Toronto that reportedly cost nearly $4,000. \"If we didn't have to worry about housing, I think these trips would be more manageable and a lot less stressful,\" the family wrote.

There may be a remedy for that, or at least a way to wise up on crappy hotel internet.  Hotelwifitest.com  is a website that does exactly as its name suggests, serving you search results for hotels which are ranked on the quality of their internet service. Quality of internet ratings exist in some hotel guides, but Hotel WiFi Test aims to go beyond merely crowdsourcing information thanks to its “state-of-the-art” machine learning technology which can predict the quality of on-site wireless. “The prediction tool works in a similar way to the actual thought process of an experienced traveler. People who travel a lot know that WiFi is faster in some cities and countries than in others, that certain hotel chains provide superior internet services, and that a number of other factors affect WiFi speed,” the company says . The site claims to cover over 100,000 hotels worldwide.You search based on city, and the results rank the hotels while showing a range of expected WiFi speeds, alongside all the usual metrics that matter: such as price, address and ratings from Hotel.com. (TLDR: hotel internet is slow in Bangkok , compared to places like New York — as you’d expect.) It would take us a while to road test these ratings — I’m certainly game to do so — nonetheless the approach is likely to appeal to many, even as a guide not a factual site, since the internet is ubiquitous in day’s age. Plenty of us rank the ease in which we can get (and stay) online from our lodgings as an important factor in our booking decision. That factor becomes essential if you are traveling on business. One more thing I’d like to see is the cost of WiFi at hotels included in search results. Given what we established above about the importance of the internet today — everyone walks around carrying a phone-sized web device in their pocket — charging people for something that has become so basic is tantamount to extortion. That said, most hotels do explain on their website whether WiFi access is free, so often it just takes some digging. ➤ Hotelwifitest.com  | Via Hacker News Headline image via Kevin Dooley / Flickr", "score"=>172.64922, "summaryTitle"=>"This website ranks hotels based on the quality of their WiFi", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Hotel WiFi Test wants to avoid the dreaded feeling of arriving at a hotel with terrible WiFi.", "cities"=>"null", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/07/25/this-website-ranks-hotels-based-on-the-quality-of-their-wifi/", "referrer"=>["tnw.co", "bottlenose.com", "direct", "app.net", "google.co.uk", "t.co", "lnkd.in", "facebook.com", "google.com", "linkedin.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1AeGlhS", "lastseen"=>"20140726004712", "page"=>"http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/07/25/this-website-ranks-hotels-based-on-the-quality-of-their-wifi/", "ogtitle"=>"Rank Hotels Based on the Quality of Their WiFi"}, {"domain"=>"nhl.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406322829000", "h2"=>["Friday, 25.07.2014 / 4:40 PM", "Toronto Maple Leafs", "Thursday, 24.07.2014 / 8:50 AM", "NHL.com", "Wednesday, 23.07.2014 / 9:03 AM", "By Tal Pinchevsky", "Tuesday, 22.07.2014 / 3:33 PM", "Toronto Maple Leafs", "Tuesday, 22.07.2014 / 3:14 PM", "NHL.com", "Friday, 25.07.2014 / 2:17 PM", "NHL.com", "Friday, 25.07.2014 / 1:50 PM", "NHL.com", "Friday, 25.07.2014 / 12:00 PM", "By Matt Sitkoff", "Friday, 25.07.2014 / 9:22 AM", "NHL.com", "Friday, 25.07.2014 / 3:00 AM", "By Kurt Dusterberg"], "site"=>"mapleleafs.nhl.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004414", "keywords"=>"Toronto Maple Leafs, maple leafs stats, maple leafs roster, maple leafs schedule, maple leafs tickets, maple leafs hockey tickets, maple leafs ticket, maple leafs hockey, maple leafs, hockey, nhl, Toronto, nhl maple leafs, maple leafs fan club, Toronto nhl", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335454297", "title"=>"Leafs, Reimer Agree To Terms - Toronto Maple Leafs - News", "initial"=>"20140725211349", "summaryText"=>"David Nonis, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs, announced Friday the hockey club has agreed to terms with goaltender James Reimer on a two-year contract.

He is a former member of the Michigan Education Association. Archive» WASHINGTON, D.C. – Michelle Obama’s effort to slim down America’s youth has struck a “potentially transformative” deal with a major agriculture company. DailyLeak.org reports the first lady is teaming up with Monsanto to promote “‘healthy’ genetically modified food to children.” The company has agreed to spend $50 million on the effort over five years. “When I see a company like Monsanto launch an initiative like this, I feel more hopeful than ever before,” Obama at a recent event to announce the deal. “We can improve how we make and sell food in this country.” “It’s a natural extension of what we do,” Monsanto official Michael Stern, told the Associated Press. Maybe so, but it’s not clear how a company that’s primarily known for producing seeds and herbicides for farmers is going to nudge children into eating foods the first lady thinks they should be eating. Details of this deal have been sketchy, perhaps intentionally so. After all, the unholy alliance of Big Government and Big Business is one definition of fascism . DailyLeak.org suggests the first lady’s willingness to partner with a big food corporation could be yet another sign that “she’s getting more aggressive” about promoting her “Let’s Move!” anti-childhood obesity campaign. “Late last year she convened a White House summit to convince agribusiness to rethink their marketing efforts towards children,” the news site notes. That wasn’t the first time Michelle Obama has urged a food-related company to “rethink” its business practices. In 2012, the Mars candy company agreed to discontinue its king-size candy bars , in deference to the first lady’s effort to control what Americans eat. “Let’s Move!” Executive Director Sam Kass called the White House’s deal with Monsanto “potentially transformative.” Again, what that means in specific, concrete terms is anyone’s guess. But as DailyLeak.org notes, “One move by Monsanto can ripple throughout the industry, and the company has grown increasingly bold in tackling complex social and political issues.” The company also has strong ties to Democrats. Again from DailyLeak.org: “In recent years, Monsanto has reached out to Democrats and sought out political appointments within government. Michael Taylor, Monsanto’s former Vice President for Public Policy, is now Deputy Commissioner of the Federal Drug and Food Administration.” Comments Tags: bog government , candy bars , Control , food , Let's Move , Michelle Obama , Monsanto , Sam Kass Posted on: July 25th, 2014 by Ben Velderman", "score"=>172.39629, "summaryTitle"=>"EAGnews.org powered by Education Action Group Foundation, Inc.", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Education Research, Reporting, Analysis and Commentary powered by Education Action Group Foundation", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://eagnews.org/michelle-o-partnering-with-big-food-company-to-promote-genetically-modified-food/", "referrer"=>["bing.com", "iconfactory.com", "direct", "t.co", "inagist.com", "tweetlist.com", "twitterrific.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1noW9JF", "lastseen"=>"20140726004218", "page"=>"http://eagnews.org/michelle-o-partnering-with-big-food-company-to-promote-genetically-modified-food/"}, {"domain"=>"alliancedefendingfreedom.org", "initial_epoch"=>"1406327582000", "h3"=>["About Us", "Key Issues", "Take Action", "Donate", "Get Legal Help"], "site"=>"blog.alliancedefendingfreedom.org", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004358", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335438573", "title"=>"Executive Order: Conform Your Theology, or Stop Helping People « Alliance Defending Freedom Blog", "initial"=>"20140725223302", "summaryText"=>"This week, President Obama made an executive order demanding that only organizations who agree with the administration’s view of sexuality are eligible to receive government contracts, refusing the requests from Christian and other religious faith leaders", "content"=>"This week, President Obama made an executive order demanding that only organizations who agree with the administration’s view of sexuality are eligible to receive government contracts, refusing the requests from Christian and other religious faith leaders for an exemption for religious non-profits. What Changed? This order amends an order from 1965 prohibiting contractors from discriminating “against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” The President’s revision added “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” Because they can’t “discriminate,” religious organizations with federal contracts won’t be able to require their employees to hold to the tenets of their faith. For example, a Catholic organization wouldn’t be able to refuse to hire someone who doesn’t hold to the Catholic beliefs about marriage and sexuality. But there is a sort of “patchwork of protections” in place, because this order doesn’t do away with a 2002 order from George W. Bush that allows religious groups to “consult their beliefs” when hiring or firing. The executive order affects organizations with federal contracts , not grant recipients, so organizations like World Vision, Catholic Charities, and World Relief might be in the clear … for now. However, prison ministries and military ministries are commonly contracted, and the government is increasingly using contracts instead of grants for overseas relief work. Sexual Rights or Religious Rights? Religious leaders sent two letters in June and July asking the President to allow them to continue the hiring processes they’ve used since he took office. “We must find a way to respect diversity of opinion on this issue in a way that respects the dignity of all parties to the best of our ability,” the letter reads. Obama refused to include any protections for religious organizations in the executive order. By refusing, he sent a clear message: sexual rights trump religious rights. Joe Biden summed it up: “I don’t care what your culture is,” he said. “Inhumanity is inhumanity. Prejudice is prejudice is prejudice.” Except when it’s not. The Obama administration is clearly under the disillusion that protecting the freedom to speak and act on the belief that marriage is the union of a man and woman is the same as racist segregation. It’s not. If religious organizations can’t require their employees to hold to their faith, the organization can’t operate according to their faith. It’s as ludicrous as demanding that a Democratic lobbying organization hire Republicans. At that point, it’s no longer Democratic. Essentially, the administration is holding a carrot over a cliff. Take the carrot and conform your theology, or stop helping people. Of course, some of these organizations may be able to raise the funding they need to continue without the government’s help. But the reason the government worked with these organizations to begin with was because they do good work and benefit others. It was in the government’s interest to use tax payer funds to aid the work that these groups were doing to benefit communities in the states and abroad. In one of the letters to President Obama urging him to include a religious exemption, the faith leaders wrote: “In a concrete way, religious organizations will lose financial funding that allows them to serve others in the national interest due to their organizational identity. When the capacity of religious organizations is limited, the common good suffers .” Now, the government is using an executive order to enforce a moral judgment. Thus, the only organizations worthy of taxpayer funds are those that agree with what the government says is morally correct, not what their faith or their conscience dictates. “That’s the kind of government entanglement with religion that the Founders sought to prevent and that the First Amendment prohibits,” said Kristen Waggoner, ADF Senior Counsel. Where It’s Going Although as a grantee World Relief isn’t yet affected, Jenny Yang, its vice president of advocacy and policy, isn’t resting easy. “Our main concern is its implication on religious freedom down the line, where future executive orders could also include not just federal contractors but grantees as well,” she said. “It’s a slippery slope, and we feel the need to speak up whenever we feel like religious freedom is threatened.” And speaking of prejudice, the faith leaders who signed the pleas to the President are already facing backlash. After D. Michael Lindsay, President of Gordon College, a Christian university, signed one of the letters to the President, the city of Salem canceled their contract with the school, and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges decided to evaluate the school’s accreditation. Why? They claimed that the college now advocates for discrimination against the LGBT community , even though the college’s hiring process hasn’t changed . If Christian non-profits aren’t allowed to be Christian, and if Christian colleges aren’t allowed to be Christian, how long before this trend affects churches too? If the government edicts that only non-profits that conform their theology to the homosexual agenda are worthy of tax dollars, it’s not a stretch to say that only non-profits that fit the new moral norm are worthy of tax exemptions . Then it will be up to the church to decide whether they will conform or face the consequences. What can you do? Encourage your pastor to stand for truth by joining Pulpit Freedom Sunday . And speak up for religious freedom with your friends and family, on social media, or where you have the opportunity to make a difference.", "score"=>172.31316, "summaryTitle"=>"Executive Order: Conform Your Theology, or Stop Helping People", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"This week, President Obama made an executive order demanding that only organizations who agree with the administration&rsquo;s view of sexuality are...", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://blog.alliancedefendingfreedom.org/2014/07/25/executive-order-conform-your-theology-or-stop-helping-people/", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "direct", "bit.ly", "tweetlist.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1nDPr1X", "lastseen"=>"20140726004352", "page"=>"http://blog.alliancedefendingfreedom.org/2014/07/25/executive-order-conform-your-theology-or-stop-helping-people/", "ogtitle"=>"Executive Order: Conform Your Theology, or Stop Helping People"}, {"domain"=>"golfdigest.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406322354000", "h2"=>["When Rory McIlroy is on, no one can touch him.", "Related Links", "The latest on golf digest"], "h3"=>["Equipment", "Instruction", "Courses & Travel", "News / Golf World", "Video", "Top Stories:", "The Complete Hot List", "Tune Up Your Game", "100 Greatest Public Courses", "Stay In The Loop", "The Hot List", "Make The Turn", "Behind the Scenes", "Have Your Breakout Summer", "Search & Compare: The Hot List", "27 Best Open Pictures", "Hoylake Course Tour", "17 Things That Only Happen At The Open", "Duf, In His Own Words", "Golf Digest Stix E-Magazine", "Thank you for signing up for the newsletter.", "most viewed", "most emailed", "Condé Nast Digital", "Visit our sister sites", "Subscribe to a magazine"], "site"=>"www.golfdigest.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726003640", "keywords"=>"British Open, Hoylake, golf, rory mcilroy, rickie fowler, tiger woods, tom watson, british-open, Sam Weinman, Ryan Herrington, Alex Myers, Luke Kerr-Dineen", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335000995", "title"=>"British Open: 15 Undeniable Truths After The Open : Golf Digest", "initial"=>"20140725210554", "summaryText"=>"Let's start with the obvious.

Pope Francis eats with Vatican workers during a surprise visit to the Vatican cafeteria July 25. (CNS/L'Osservatore Romano via Reuters) He acted \"normally, like the humblest of the workers,\" Paini said, his voice still trembling from the thrill. \"Please forgive me, I'm still excited, you know?\" Wearing his white cassock and zucchetto, the pope grabbed an orange plastic tray and chose what he wanted from the array of prepared foods. He got a plate of pasta without sauce; a portion of cod; a whole wheat roll; some \"au gratin\" vegetables; a few French fries; an apple; and a bottle of spring water -- but not the fizzy, bubbly kind, witnessed reported. \"I didn't have the courage to give him the bill,\" said Claudia Di Giacomo, who was sitting behind the cash register. Paini said the pope made everyone feel at ease. \"We introduced ourselves, he asked how we were, what it was like working there, he paid us compliments; it was really nice.\" The cafeteria in the Vatican's \"industrial area\" serves employees who work as technicians, electricians, plumbers, metalworkers, craftsmen, but also employees of the Vatican newspaper, L' Osservatore Romano. The pope sat down to eat at a table with workers from the Vatican pharmacy's warehouse. Wearing dark blue uniform polo shirts, the men spoke to the pope about their jobs and the pope talked about his Italian heritage. Table talk also included soccer and the economy, the Vatican newspaper reported. The whole time the pope was eating and chatting, people were taking the inevitable selfie with their cameras, cellphones and iPads. \"Pope Francis wasn't bothered a bit\" by the constant clicking, \"and continued to smile and eat, carrying out the conversation\" with his tablemates, the paper said. The pope didn't stay for the full lunch hour, heading for the door after about 40 minutes. But he gave all the workers there his blessing and posed for a group photograph before he left in his assistant's car to drive back to his residence at the Domus Sanctae Marthae. Paini said the surprise visit was \"totally a bolt out of the blue. Who'd have thought! The pope coming to eat with us? Hah!

Linebacker / defensive lineman Mike Neal and linebacker Nick Perry were both placed on PUP, according to the NFL transaction wire. That means they failed their physicals due to injuries they suffered while with the Packers. It does not mean the two are out all of camp. They are on the active PUP, which means as soon as they're capable of passing their physicals they can practice. If they don't practice in camp, then they would be eligible to start the season on PUP, which would mean they would be out at least six weeks. Neal, who has missed 28 of a possible 64 regular-season games but played in all 16 last year, was healthy during the off-season. Perry has missed 15 of a possible 32 regular-season games and played in just 11 last year because of a foot injury. The first-round pick missed all but 10 games in 2012 due to a wrist injury. The transaction wire did not specify what injury either had suffered. In addition, seventh-round pick Jeff Janis and veteran free agent Letroy Guion were put on reserve lists. Janis, a receiver, was put on the non-football illness list and Guion, a nose tackle, was put on the non-football injury list. The non-football designation indicates that it was not a result of anything they did during the off-season with the Packers. Both are on the active list, which means they can be cleared to play once they pass their physicals. Specifics were not given about their ailments. Earlier in the day, coach Mike McCarthy said he didn't know the status of linebacker Clay Matthews. However, Matthews was not on the transaction wire, so he has passed his physical.  The Packers could still hold him out of practice if they have concerns about his thumb, but the fact he passed means he's probably cleared.", "score"=>171.97954, "summaryTitle"=>"Neal, Perry start camp on physically unable to perform list", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Green Bay - Two players who have struggled with injuries during their pro careers will start the season on the physically unable to perform list for the Green Bay Packers.", "cities"=>"us-wi", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/268654892.html", "referrer"=>["direct", "t.co", "sportsmanias.com", "bleacherreport.com", "go.com", "packerrats.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1l1JHet", "lastseen"=>"20140726004300", "page"=>"http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/268654892.html", "ogtitle"=>"Neal, Perry start camp on physically unable to perform list - JSOnline"}, {"domain"=>"deadspin.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406322240000", "h3"=>"Samer Kalaf", "site"=>"deadspin.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004644", "keywords"=>"stephen a. smith, first take, espn, chad johnson, Deadspin", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335604669", "title"=>"I Do Not Believe Women Provoke Violence, Says Stephen A.

Smith and Skip Bayless continued to discuss the Ray Rice suspension … This morning, First Take panelist Stephen A. Smith said some very dumb things about domestic… The link might not work for some of you, so here's the full text: My series of tweets a short time ago is not an adequate way to capture my thoughts so I am using a single tweet via Twitlonger to more appropriately and effectively clarify my remarks from earlier today about the Ray Rice situation. I completely recognize the sensitivity of the issues and the confusion and disgust that my comments caused. First off, as I said earlier and I want to reiterate strongly, it is never OK to put your hands on a women. Ever. I understand why that important point was lost in my other comments, which did not come out as I intended. I want to state very clearly. I do NOT believe a woman provokes the horrible domestic abuses that are sadly such a major problem in our society. I wasn't trying to say that or even imply it when I was discussing my own personal upbringing and the important role the women in my family have played in my life. I understand why my comments could be taken another way. I should have done a better job articulating my thoughts and I sincerely apologize. OK, that's something of an apology. But it's probably bullshit. After all, this is far from the first time Smith has expressed similar opinions. Back in 2012, then-Miami Dolphins receiver Chad Johnson was accused of headbutting his then-wife, Evelyn Lozada. Smith and Bayless embraced debate on the topic over several episodes of First Take . See if Smith's thoughts, as captured in the compilation below, don't sound familiar: The whole thing is, in its way, worth watching, but the gist of Smith's argument is captured in the following riff, from Aug. 15, 2012: There are plenty of instances where provocation comes into consideration, instigation comes into consideration, and I will be on the record right here on national television and say that I am sick and tired of men constantly being vilified and accused of things and we stop there.

Namely, how they seemed to stay… boys. Bros living with a dozen roommates. Guys eating Pop-Tarts for dinner. Dudes never buying toilet paper. Even when, perhaps, they should be men. Because they are 33 years old. Hypothetically speaking. Channeling her frustration into hilarity, Hunter, along with writer-actress Megan Rosati, wrote and filmed “1-800-Adopt-A-Dude,” which asks us, “Will you be an angel for a fully grown, yet utterly helpless man?” If you think Hunter looks familiar, you may know her as the funny girl behind Adult Wednesday Addams . (She says she’s shooting the second season of AWA this weekend. Video release date TBA.) I called her up today to talk 1-800-Adopt-A-Dude, which went up, appropriately enough, on Wednesday. What’s the Adopt-a-Dude origin story? It came about based on our single dating experiences in Los Angeles, and trying to find grown men who act like grown men. I would often date a guy and then find out he shared a bedroom, or didn’t have a car, or a job. It just didn’t make sense to me that there was this epidemic of men acting like they were still in college. So we started joking about that out of frustration, and how funny it would be to place them in one of those “adopt a child” or “adopt an animal” videos. I love those, like the Sarah McLachlan ones. They’re so ripe for parody. How did the guys in the video react to these jokes? Did they take any of it personally? They’re all in my comedy community… and they were all really good sports about it. What I’ve gotten in terms of the reaction from men that I know, both from the script and the video, is a lot of them can recognize traits that they have of this kind of dude, but [the video] is a little more playful. It’s not mean-spirited, in my opinion. They were totally game. And especially with sketch comedy, all these guys that are in it do so much sketch comedy, and most of that is making yourself look the fool. Like the guy, Paul, shooting ketchup in his face. So gross! What a champion. I made sure he had a spit cup and we had the camera just right so he only had to do it once. What were you thinking about while writing these jokes? Did you have to cut anything because you thought it would be too harsh and change the playful tone of the sketch? We tried to make it true to the guy who doesn’t have his life together—and it’s not just guys who don’t have their lives together—but what we were trying to comment on is this stunted generation we are all kind of a part of. We’re coming into an economy where we can’t get real jobs or real careers. Especially the entertainment industry, everyone is trying to make it, but they’re, like, 30. So it’s like, wait a minute, how do I not have a real life? There was, in the first draft, it was a little more parallel to the Sarah McLachlan dog and animal adoption ads, and then we retooled it, because we didn’t want it to be as much about them being animals. I think that’s a little bit more degrading. It’s more about them not being fully grown adults. We wanted them to be man-child. Like you say, there are also plenty of girls who don’t have their lives together. But these issues you talk about in the video—hygiene, diet, cleanliness—are usually things that women seem to be on top of at a much earlier age than guys are. Why do you think that is? I totally agree with you. For me, I think it’s something women are trained to do as girls: we’re trained to be responsible and practical and not complain as much about our circumstances. And I think because we’re also trained at a young age to take care of our body from a looks standpoint, which is a bummer, but we translate that into nutrition, how to have a good balanced diet and take care of ourselves as people more. And also, even if we aren’t at the place in our career, let’s say, or economically, in our late twenties or early thirties, we do know that we have a much more present clock. If we want to have a family, we need to have our lives together. And we’re reminded of that so much more than men are, who can wait until they’re 45 to even think about it. For women, it’s societally looked down on. At 35, we should be at a place where we can start a family. Those are the societal pressures that push us into becoming real people. It also sometimes seems like guys expect that, once a woman enters their life, that’s when all these things will change. There’s this subset of guy who appears to be waiting for the girlfriend to show up, and then makeover montage his apartment into a place that is clean and livable, for instance. I think that’s really true. Funny enough, the ones of my guy friends who do have their shit together a little bit more, is either because they have a girlfriend right now who tells them how to dress, or they had a girlfriend who taught them how to make real meals and exercise and dress in a certain way and have real sheets on their bed. I think it’s a motherly aspect that men except women to bring them through. And it’s both from a physical, exterior superficial standpoint—how you dress, what you eat—and emotionally, too. I think a lot of men don’t have emotional relationships with other men, digging into who they are and what problems they have, unless they’re with a woman. I noticed that once when I had a boyfriend, a long time ago, and we broke up, and months later he called me when something really bad happened to him. I realized his guy friends don’t talk to him about that stuff. He still missed and wanted that. Aside from the cultural pressures and male expectations you’ve talked about, do you think some of this is a pressure women put on ourselves? That there are girls who go into relationships kind of excited about the prospect of, for lack of a better phrase, a fixer-upper? I think we’re all kind of complicit in it, and that’s part of the commentary that we wanted to put forward: it’s not anyone’s fault, necessarily, it’s just the way our society works right now. Maybe it’s something that we want men to change, to be the guy that we want them to be, so being able to change the way they dress or eat is almost an easy way to think that they’re going to be better people, better boyfriends, better partners. There’s a satisfaction to teaching someone about something. I think that’s true in any relationship. I’ve been in a relationship where someone knew everything about music, and he was so excited to teach me about classic rock. It was something he could bring to the table. And also maybe it’s like, we can’t control or change the way men think in a macro level, so maybe on a micro level, we can do that. ^This girl knows what we’re talking about. And some of it is just being practical, right, from a woman’s standpoint. Like not dating someone who doesn’t keep their bathroom stocked with toilet paper. We have these rules set out: I can’t live with someone who is living with eight dudes in this big house and they’ve never cleaned the kitchen floor in their lives. There was a certain point when I would date those boys, and I am not at that point anymore. It’s remarkable, the rate of change post-college, and [the difference between] women and men. I think it’s these years out of college that for some reason, generally, are able to become fully functioning adults that some men just don’t ever reach until they have a girlfriend or a wife to “adopt” them. It’s like, they’re just living with the same guys they’re living with in college microwaving ramen and leaving trash bags of beer cans on the stairs. Have any of the responses been negative? I got a few angry comments on YouTube, “Not every man is like this.” It recalled the “not all men” thing. Yeah! That’s fine! They’re not! There are plenty of men who are great. And even in the video I say, “hundreds of thousands” intentionally. There are hundreds of millions of men out there. So it’s only one percent, but it’s still an epidemic. Which of these jokes in the video feel the most true to you? I think there were two – the roll of toilet paper, that’s probably my favorite joke. Because it seems SO simple, and so basic, that of course, you can have toilet paper too! All it costs is the cost of a roll of toilet paper. It seems silly that it’s so hard. And the other joke is the one where Megan is reading the book and it says “Donate in the next five minutes, and you’ll get a text every day from your dude, asking, like, you know, how your day was. Really basic shit.” Because I feel like that’s something, when I’m dating someone, or my friend is dating someone, everything that we have to ask of them seems SO basic. If you’re in a relationship, just checking in every day.", "score"=>171.87032, "summaryTitle"=>"1-800-Adopt-A-Dude: Because Hundreds Of Thousands Of Dudes Struggle Each Day", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"&quot;Will you be an angel for a fully grown, yet utterly helpless man?&quot;", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://thinkprogress.org/culture/2014/07/25/3464370/1-800-adopt-a-dude/", "referrer"=>["twittergadget.com", "t.co", "direct", "favstar.fm"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1rRQ6xy", "lastseen"=>"20140726002844", "page"=>"http://thinkprogress.org/culture/2014/07/25/3464370/1-800-adopt-a-dude/", "ogtitle"=>"1-800-Adopt-A-Dude: Because Hundreds Of Thousands Of Dudes Struggle Each Day"}, {"domain"=>"cracked.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406305953000", "h2"=>"The Weekly Hit List", "h3"=>["The 40 Most Insane Easter Eggs Ever Found", "6 Famous Documentaries That Were Shockingly Full of Crap", "4 Things I Learned from the Worst Online Dating Profile Ever", "Recommended For Your Pleasure"], "site"=>"www.cracked.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004557", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335557680", "title"=>"24 Things the CIA Is (Probably) Keeping From Us | Cracked.com", "initial"=>"20140725163233", "summaryText"=>"By Cracked Readers July 25, 2014 26,762 Views Slideshow View The CIA, by definition, pulls some pretty sneaky shit.

Even though it is hard to get used to seeing Revis wearing Patriots colors — it's been an adjustment for him, too — he admitted to the Daily News on Friday that after the Bucs cut him in March, he had his agent reach out to the Jets to initiate a reunion: The Jets were not interested and Revis signed with New England. Sources told the Daily News in March that Revis' first choice was to come back to the Jets. \"You know, that was a possibility,\" Revis said after doing a group interview Friday at the Patriots’ training camp. Revis insisted, however, that he wasn’t disappointed that the Jets had no interest in bringing him back.? \"I wasn't disappointed about that,\" he said. Revis also said he didn’t think his long, bitter holdouts in 2007 and 2010 made a return to the Jets less than feasible. \"It really doesn't matter,\" he said. \"It's an organization. They are going to run it how they want to run it and choose who they want to choose. There's no hard feelings. You got to move on.\" Ultimately, there were about 20 teams that had some degree of interest in Revis. New England had the best package: $12 million for 2014, a chance to play with Tom Brady and a legitimate opportunity for Revis to get to his first Super Bowl. Because New England will not pick up his $20 million option for 2015, Revis will be in position to be a free agent again. AP What's not to like about that deal? \"I just wanted to pick the best situation for me,\" he said. \"I felt New England was the best situation for me.\" Revis has transitioned to the other side of the most bitter rivalry in the NFL. When you're a Jet, you hate the Patriots. When you're a Patriot, you hate the Jets. \"I know it's a rivalry. My focus is to just go out there and play,\" he said. \"I'm not trying to get back at anybody. It is what it is. New York was great to me during the time I was there. You got to move on. Tampa was great for me when I was in Tampa for the year. Now New England is being great to me as well.\" During the group interview, Revis said the fans at Patriots camp — they get about 8,000 per day — have been \"awesome\" to him, but \"it's been kind of weird in a way. I'm a Patriot now. That's how things go. You just got to roll with it. They accepted me.\" He was asked why is has been weird, and laughed, saying: \"Because I was on the other side with another team — with a rival. But I'm here now.\" Revis tore his ACL in the Jets third game of the 2012 season. Although he played in every game for Tampa last year, he says he never felt right. Now, he says, he's in the best shape of his career and his left knee feels as good as it did before he tore the ACL. \"They say it takes a year and a half or two. I think I'm at a point now where I'm there. I'm back to where I can move around a little bit better,\" he said. \"Last year was really tough coming off the injury, even though I played in all 16 games. But it was just tough. I wasn't where I needed to be. Now I'm a little bit more excited. I feel butterflies more. I'm just ready.\" Antonelli, Ron, New York Daily N/Antonelli, Ron, New York Daily N Last offseason, he was rehabbing, this year, he was working out. If he's back to being the Revis of old, then the Patriots got themselves the best cornerback in the league. Revis quickly has become a team leader. He works out in Phoenix in the offseason and had several of his teammates come join him. He has been accepted by the players and has been building a strong relationship with Bill Belichick. He says he is glad he and Brady will \"have the same color jersey on Sunday. It's awesome.\" Two years ago, he called Belichick a jerk. Now they are best buds. \"Our relationship is great,\" Revis said. \"We communicate well. Bill is open to anything. Being on the other side, you look at him totally different. But being here, he's open to anything and our friendship is great.\" Belichick calls all the shots with the Patriots. He wanted Revis and got him signed. Rex Ryan very much wanted to bring Revis back, but he doesn't have final say. \"He's the head coach. That's his title,\" Revis said of Ryan. Revis attempted to dismiss the mental adjustment from switching sides in the rivalry by saying, \"It doesn't matter what color you got on. I always look at it as long as I'm playing the game that I love, it really doesn't matter. I was on that side. You're not supposed to like your rival no matter where you play. I'm here now. All that is in the past. Right now, I'm a Patriot. I'm excited to be here.\" He wanted to be a Jet again.

Ikano Bank", "content"=>"Source: IKEA via Bloomberg Close Ikea billionaire Ingvar Kamprad made his fortune helping the world stay frugal with cheap home furnishings. The same model is now being peddled at his bank, where customers get rewards for resisting luxury. Ikano Bank is trying to lure savers by offering a 100,000 krona ($14,625) prize in the form of deposits to the winner of a computer game that punishes players who waste money on pricey goods. In “Flappy Saver,” a knock-off of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird, the player best able to navigate hurdles such as jewelery stores and shoe shops wins the highest score by protecting savings stored in a flying piggy bank. Ikano’s savings campaign comes as competition for household deposits is intensifying amid stricter stable funding rules for banks. Closely held Ikano is taking on competitors by offering higher deposit rates. That was underscored this month after the central bank lowered its main rate by half a percentage point to 0.25 percent, putting pressure on deposit rates at Nordea Bank AB and Sweden’s three other big lenders. “We want to get new customers to discover Ikano and do something for small savers, in whom most major banks aren’t that interested,” Emma Roslund Johansson, a sales manager at Ikano’s Swedish operations, said in a telephone interview. Testing Zero Ikano’s rates range from 0.70 percent on regular savings accounts to 2.65 percent on fixed deposits. It’s not alone in taking on Sweden’s biggest banks. Nordnet AB, which offers online banking services, offers 0.55 percent, while the banking arm of supermarket chain Ica Gruppen AB offers 0.75 percent. State-owned lender SBAB has a 1.40 percent rate on its savings account. “The major banks’ low deposit rates make an increasing number choose savings accounts outside the four big banks,” Tor Borg, chief economist at SBAB, said in an e-mailed response to questions. “The closer to zero the major banks’ interest rates go, the clearer the difference, and probably also the tendency among households to move.” Nordea , the Nordic region’s largest bank, and Swedbank AB , Sweden’s biggest mortgage lender, lowered the rates they pay on some savings accounts to zero after the Riksbank’s rate cut. SEB AB cut the rate on its general savings account by 10 basis points to 0.20 percent and Svenska Handelsbanken AB reduced rates on a number of its accounts. Valuable Deposits Handelsbanken, Nordea, SEB and Swedbank’s combined share of total Swedish deposits from the public, which includes both household and corporate deposits, declined to 68.6 percent in 2013 from 69.9 percent a year earlier and 75.3 percent in 2008, according to data from the Swedish Bankers’ Association. Household deposits at Nordea’s Swedish retail operations fell 1.4 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to its second-quarter report. Still, some major banks are going the opposite way, with Handelsbanken reporting an annual 8.8 percent jump in household deposits last quarter. Meanwhile, Swedes are saving more in total. Household deposits at Swedish banks rose to 1.36 trillion kronor in May, from 1.34 trillion kronor in April and 1.27 trillion kronor at the end of 2012, according to the country’s statistics agency. Ikano’s “Flappy Saver” competition, which ran from June 27 until July 18, was played 1.52 million times, Matilda Lenner Payne, Ikano’s head of marketing, said. “Competition has increased, partly because new regulation is making deposits more valuable for banks,” Roslund Johansson said. “New players need savings to create financing for their lending and we have also in recent years seen more competition from bigger banks that want to secure their financing.” To contact the reporter on this story: Katarina Gustafsson in Stockholm at kgustafsson@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story: Daniel Tilles at dtilles@bloomberg.net Tasneem Hanfi Brogger, Niklas Magnusson", "score"=>171.68364, "summaryTitle"=>"Banking Ikea Style Puts Billionaire Model to Test: Nordic Credit", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Ikea billionaire Ingvar Kamprad made his fortune helping the world stay frugal with cheap home furnishings.

Bose on Friday filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission (ITC), asking the agency to block the importation of Beats headphones that infringe on Bose patents. It also filed suit in Delaware district court. Specifically, Bose argues that the Beats Studio headphones infringe on the active noise reduction (ANR) technology found in Bose QuietComfort 20 and QuietComfort 20i Acoustic Noise Cancelling headphones, which is covered in five Bose-held patents. But Bose reserves the right to expand the scope of the suit. \"Beats has designed the infringing ANR functionality to be used automatically when a user is listening to music, and instructs a user on how to implement ANR functionality when a user simply desires noise reduction,\" the complaint says. \"Thus, Beats specifically encourages users to use the infringing functionality.\" Also named in the suit are Fugang Electronic and PCH International Ltd., which manufacture and import Beats headphones, respectively. It's unclear if Bose and Beats tried to reach an agreement prior to the filing of these suits. Apple announced in May that it will pay $3 billion for Beats Electronics and its Beats Music streaming-music service, making it Apple's largest acquisition to date. The purchase price is $2.6 billion, plus $400 million that will vest over time. As part of the deal, Beats co-founders Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre will join Apple. Apple said this week that it expects the Beats deal to close later this year. For more, see PCMag's review of Beats by Dr. Dre Studio and Beats Studio Wireless .

United take on AS Roma in the International Champions Cup in Denver on Saturday off the back of their stunning 7-0 victory over LA Galaxy on Wednesday night in their opening game of their pre-season tour of the USA. In transfer news, reports suggest Netherlands star Memphis Depay will ‘snub’ interest from Premier League clubs in order to sign for United in the future, suggesting the 20-year-old, who is reportedly being tracked by Tottenham, could decide to stay at PSV Eindhoven this summer. Meanwhile, Real Madrid winger Angel Di Maria will choose between United and PSG , according to reports. The Argentina star is expected to make a decision in the ‘next few days’. Paris Saint-Germain boss Laurent Blanc insists no deal is complete for Angel Di Maria as yet. The French champions, however, ‘retain’ their ‘interest’ the £49 million-rated midfielder. “I'll leave you to speculate. At the moment nothing is done. Are there negotiations? It's not for me to say, but for the board of the club,” he said. This comes as Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti insists Angel Di Maria has a place in the team at the Bernabeu with the European champions. \"He (Di Maria) is a Real Madrid player. He will arrive (at training) on August 5,” stated Ancelotti. \"With the signings of Rodriguez and Kroos there is more competition in the centre of the pitch, but that's how it is at the big clubs.” The Express claims United have ‘outbid’ Barcelona in a bid to sign Daley Blind who is reportedly valued around £17 million by Ajax for the Netherlands international.

Long Beach police also said Thursday that the woman's accomplice has been arrested on suspicion of murder for taking part in a crime that led to her death. Police Chief Jim McDonnell says Tom Greer is cooperating with the investigation, but he wouldn't say whether charges will be recommended to prosecutors. McDonnell said, \"Basically, you can defend yourself in you're in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death.

The chief says Andrea Miller, 28, didn't appear pregnant, but an autopsy would provide the answer. But McDonnell says the murder charge against Gus Adams, 26, is possible because he's accused of being involved in a felony that led to a death. Greer told a local news outlet that he walked in on the burglars Tuesday night and tried to shoot both of them as they fled, but Adams got away and he was only able to hit Miller.

As I’ve said in the past, I don’t expect him to be the Ryan Howard of 2006, 2007, 2008. What we expect is him to perform better than he is. I know he’s a better player than this. “Has to keep working and it’s up to us to help facilitate that. That’s on him and on us to help him get back to being a productive player.” Howard is owed $60 million after this season. Amaro reiterated that releasing the player “has not been a thought.” Amaro was asked if he expected to see Howard in Clearwater in February. “I absolutely anticipate that to be the case, certainly,” he said. Howard, 34, is hitting .224 with 15 homers, 57 RBIs and 118 strikeouts in 371 at-bats this season. His OPS is .682 and ranks 126th out of 162 qualifying major-league hitters. His OPS ranks 21st out of 23 qualifying major-league first basemen. Over his last 25 games, Howard is hitting just .168 (16 for 95) with a .269 on-base percentage and a .221 slugging percentage. He has just three extra-base hits in that span. Howard has not played in the Phillies' last two games. He sat out against lefty Madison Bumgarner on Wednesday and did not play against right-hander Tim Hudson on Thursday. Howard had traditionally hit Hudson well so his absence from the lineup Thursday appeared to be a benching by manager Ryan Sandberg. Before the game, Sandberg mentioned that he was considering platooning Howard with right-handed hitter Darin Ruf. The Phillies face a lefty pitcher Friday night so it will be interesting to see what the manager does. Amaro said a platoon is possible. “It’s a possibility, if we get more production from the team that way,” Amaro said. “But it doesn’t have be a straight platoon. The job of the manager is to put the best team on the field to win that night’s game. “I don’t make up the lineup. I never have. I make suggestions from time to time, but the manager makes up the lineup. But if [a platoon] makes the team most productive, then maybe.” Howard wasn't happy about sitting out the last two days, especially against Hudson on Thursday. Sandberg spoke to Howard. Amaro did as well. “I think sometimes a player needs a break, just watch the game,” Amaro said. “Listen, probably no one is more disappointed than Ryan. He has a lot of pride. “It happens to the best players in the game. Guys go in funks. He’s been there a while.” Amaro said Howard “should have no concerns” about being released. Amaro is deep in trade conversations with other clubs and it’s no secret that Howard’s name has been floated out there. CBS Sports reported that Amaro is “aggressively” trying to move Howard and is willing to eat a huge chunk of salary to do it. Amaro has a policy of not commenting on trade rumors regardless of validity, but he did say, “I don’t know where that comes from. I don’t comment on BS like that.” Howard was the NL Rookie of the Year in 2005, the NL MVP in 2006 and a World Series winner in 2008. He averaged 50 homers and 143 RBIs from 2006 to 2009 and signed a five-year, $125 million contract in 2010, more than a year before he would have been a free agent. Howard ruptured his Achilles tendon in the final game of the 2011 season and has not been the same player since. Amaro was asked if he believed the Howard contact, which runs through 2016, was a mistake. “I’ll answer that question when the contract is over,” he said. “Just like I was asked with Pat Burrell’s contract. We were very satisfied with Burrell when he was on top of that fire truck with his dog.”", "score"=>170.62108, "summaryTitle"=>"Ruben Amaro shoots down Ryan Howard release talk", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>["us-pa", "us-nj"], "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.csnphilly.com/baseball-philadelphia-phillies/ruben-amaro-shoots-down-ryan-howard-release-talk", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "direct", "netvibes.com", "t.co", "sportsmanias.com", "philaphans.com", "bleacherreport.com", "comcast.net"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/WQ5HTU", "lastseen"=>"20140726004315", "page"=>"http://www.csnphilly.com/baseball-philadelphia-phillies/ruben-amaro-shoots-down-ryan-howard-release-talk", "ogtitle"=>"Ruben Amaro shoots down Ryan Howard release talk"}, {"domain"=>"huffingtonpost.co.uk", "initial_epoch"=>"1406277337000", "h2"=>["More:", "Most Popular", "FOLLOW HUFFPOST"], "h3"=>"Use this form to alert a HuffPost editor about a factual or typographical error in this story.", "site"=>"www.huffingtonpost.co.uk", "lastindexed"=>"20140726002624", "keywords"=>"the, recession, is, over?, 11, problems, osborne, would, prefer, you, ignored, uk, politics", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406334384000", "title"=>"The Recession Is Over? 11 Problems Osborne Would Prefer You Ignored", "initial"=>"20140725083537", "summaryText"=>"Asa Bennett Become a fan reddit George Osborne and the coalition are set to seize on official figures out today that confirm Britain's economy has fully recovered.

Mr Taylor, chief executive of the oil trading firm Vitol, gave the money in a personal capacity in support of a No vote in the independence referendum. It has been reported that Vitol is negotiating a finance deal with Kremlin-controlled Rosneft, which has been targeted by US sanctions against President Vladimir Putin. Vitol declined to comment because the company \"never comments on client relationships\" and states that it will remain \"fully compliant with all applicable international laws and regulations\". Mr Taylor has also made significant donations in support of the Conservative Party. SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson said: \"It is simply unbelievable that the No campaign is happy to accept donations from people like Ian Taylor - and in light of these further revelations Alistair Darling can't dodge this issue any more. He must finally do the decent thing and hand this money back.\" It is not the first time the SNP has called for Mr Taylor's donation to be returned. First Minister Alex Salmond questioned the donation last year because of Vitol's past business dealings. The firm was fined by a New York court in 2007 after admitting making payments to the national oil company in Saddam Hussein's Iraq which were outside of the UN's programme. It is also reported to have paid 1 million US dollars to Serbian paramilitary leader Arkan as part of an oil deal in the 1990s.

This season, Sporting News will be reviewing the work done in booths across MLB. This time it’s the Atlanta Braves on SportSouth . As the game begins, analyst Joe Simpson notes that Braves starter Aaron Harang is 4-0 with a 2.12 ERA in his last five starts. \"So, he has reason to want to atone for some rough outings against the Miami Marlins in his career — just 5-5 with a 6.25 ERA.\" So, before the first pitch is even thrown, there is reason to scratch your head. What connection could there possibly be for Harang between his last five starts in 2014 and 16 previous starts against the Marlins in a career that dates back to 2002? Simpson moves on to present the \"pitching keys to success,\" a sponsored piece from one of America's finest automobile manufacturers. The first key: \"KEEP IT ON THE DOWN-LOW.\" Simpson says Harang has to make sure to work the lower part of the strike zone, which is true for every start Harang ever has. The second key: \"STAY HOT.\" According to Simpson, \"He has been doing that, as a result of his four straight wins over five starts. Hopefully that'll continue tonight.\" The little homerific tag onto the end of a waste of breath about how the \"key\" for Harang to pitch well is basically to keep pitching well is ominous. Let's get things back on track here for the first pitch, play-by-play man Chip Caray. \"Braves gotta figure out a way to get this young man out. Christian Yelich hitting .379 in his last 14 games against Braves pitching. Eight multi-hit games in those 14.\" Another little bit of homerism, but then some pertinent information about a player's recent performance in a divisional rivalry. Maybe this will be OK. \"As is always the case, early runs are important,\" Caray says. \"And prevention of them important for Aaron Harang.\" There is no possible reason to say this during the first at-bat of the game, or, really, ever. You might as well say, \"Tonight, the Braves will be trying to score more runs than the Marlins.\" Yelich strikes out, and then Jordany Valdespin flies out, so we're getting into the flow of the game. \"We were talking about Valdespin before or during game one of this series, when he played,\" Simpson says as Valdespin heads back to the dugout. \"He kind of worked his way out of the Mets organization because he wouldn't show up on time, sometimes got to the park very late, a real malcontent, if you will. When he got called up by the Marlins, he was put on notice that he already had two strikes against him, and he had to toe the line.\" Just a reminder, in case you missed the first game of this series, Valdespin is on the Marlins, and he has a history of being a bad person who arrives late to the ballpark. If the guys in the truck could show a CGI mockup of Valdespin in a Mets uniform kicking some puppies, that would be just great. How did his Biogenesis suspension not get mentioned? Up to the plate comes Giancarlo Stanton. \"We've talked a lot about how Ryan Howard loves hitting in this park,\" Caray says. \"You cannot say the same for the Marlins right fielder.\" We've talked a lot about how pistachio ice cream is great. You cannot say the same for kale. This is a logical pair of sentences to put together, because both pistachio ice cream and kale are green foods, just like Howard and Stanton are power hitters in the National League East. Ah, who cares? Joe, hit us with those Stanton numbers. \"Both of these lineups tonight, against the respective pitchers, have good numbers,\" Simpson says. \"Up and down the lineup, there are good numbers against Aaron Harang, and against Henderson Alvarez.\" In case it's not clear from the lack of response to any points made that the announcers are barely listening to each other, Caray follows by regurgitating Simpson's earlier note of Harang's 5-5 career record against the Marlins as if it is new information. He replaces the 6.25 ERA with the fact that his last win against them came in 2011, when Harang was with the Padres. \"So, he's overdue to beat these guys,\" Caray says. Here is the list of players who played for the Marlins on Aug. 20, 2011, and for the Marlins on July 24, 2014: Giancarlo Stanton. Hey, at least that's the guy at the plate right now. Will that be mentioned? No. Stanton rips a single up the middle. Caray marvels at Casey McGehee’s 57 RBIs despite having only two home runs. He talks about what a great job McGehee has done protecting Stanton in the lineup. OK, forget for a moment that the idea of lineup protection has generally been shown to be, statistically, a bunch of hooey . Stanton leads the major leagues with 16 intentional walks this season. McGehee grounds out to end the inning. BLOOPERSTOWN At the start of the second inning, Jenn Hildreth comes on the screen, and lets us know that she is filling in for the usual in-game reporter, who has left for the induction of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and Bobby Cox to the Hall of Fame. Hildreth’s purpose is to promote “Braves Live,” with special coverage from Cooperstown all weekend. Back to Caray, who reiterates that there will be plenty of coverage of Hall of Fame festivities. “I know that Greg Maddux — I learned yesterday that he’s going in with a blank baseball cap,” Simpson says. Learned yesterday? Maddux’s no-logo plaque was announced in January . This seems like something a Braves announcer should have learned less than six months after the fact. \"Yes,\" Caray says. \"As opposed to a Cubs or a Braves logo,\" Simpson continues. \"Let's count him as a Brave, OK? At least half a Brave.\" Fine. Despite the blank cap on his plaque, the Hall of Fame’s own website lists “Atlanta Braves” as Maddux’s primary team . This is an inarguable point. Maddux pitched 363 of his 744 career games in a Braves uniform, won three of his four Cy Young Awards in Atlanta, and his World Series ring has a tomahawk on it. Go on. \"I wonder what the highest number of guys from one organization going into the Hall of Fame is, in one year,\" Simpson says. \"Is that the most?\" \"That's a good question,\" Caray says. \"I don't know.\" Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, and Frank Chance, the legendary Cubs infield trio, went into the Hall together in 1946. That’s not common knowledge, but it took approximately two minutes to look up. \"Can you remember a Hall of Fame class as large as this one in recent memory?\" Caray says. \"No,\" Simpson says. \"No, I can't.\" The 2006 class featured Bruce Sutter and 17 honorees from the Negro Leagues. If you want to exclude the Negro Leagues, and let's skip over the irony of doing so, the 1999 class had six major league inductees — George Brett, Orlando Cepeda, Nestor Chylak, Nolan Ryan, Frank Selee and Robin Young — plus Joe Williams from the New York Lincoln Giants. It's like these guys just found out that the Hall of Fame induction is this weekend thanks to Hildreth. There are exceptionally tiny amounts of research that would allow for a good discussion of baseball history and just how special this weekend is for the game in general and for the Braves franchise in particular. If only someone had bothered to let the announcers know more than 30 seconds in advance. In the bottom of the inning, Caray and Simpson have all the details of former Braves phenom and favorite son of Atlanta Jeff Francoeur's return to the major leagues with the Padres. Of course they do. GOING DEEP After a Justin Upton single, Jason Heyward's grounder for a fielder's choice, and Evan Gattis' fly to center, Chris Johnson comes to the plate for the Braves. \"Johnson unloads toward left,\" is Caray's call as the third baseman swings at Alvarez's first pitch. \"Yelich back. On the warning track — THAT BALL IS GONE! … Chris Johnson's eighth home run! And Atlanta has a 2-0 lead here in the second.\" Simpson chimes in: \"You mentioned (Nathan) Eovaldi last night throwing too many strikes early, Chip. The Braves were teeing off on first-pitch fastballs. Guess what this was? First-pitch fastball, coming back to the inner third of the plate, and it's like Chris Johnson, exactly what he was looking for. He's been on a home run tear, for him. … That's only the eighth homer Alvarez has given up.\" Just when it seems that another fact will be alluded to without the actual information being provided, Caray gives the breakdown on Johnson's home runs: five of his eight this season have come since July 12. This is Caray's finest work. His home run call is strong — informational, with an appropriate rise in volume, without going completely over the top, and letting the crowd noise (what crowd noise there is, anyway) filter through. In the third inning, Caray attempts to undo this goodwill as Yelich flies to left for the third out. \"That retires the side,\" Caray says. \"Seven up, seven down for Aaron Harang.\" This is a confusing way of saying that Harang has retired the last seven Marlins hitters, because when \"X up, X down\" is used for a number other than three to indicate a quick inning, the implication is that a perfect game is being pitched. Now, because the number used is seven, which is not a multiple of three, a viewer who missed Stanton's single in the first inning has to do a bit of thinking before realizing exactly what the announcer means. The job of the announcer is to elucidate, not to obfuscate. The fan at home should not have to parse what is being said in order to obtain basic information about the game. POETIC LICENSE Apparently, the SportSouth research department is Twitter, because fans on social media alert Caray to the answer to Simpson's question about three people from the same team going into the Hall of Fame together. Caray then recites the famous poem about Tinker, Evers, and Chance, which is pretty cool except that Simpson interrupts him. Moving on, Caray talks about the remaining games that the Braves have against the Marlins — the season series ends the first weekend of September. \"Then we'll be finished with them,\" Caray says. \"We will then become huge Marlins fans, because if memory serves, Joe, they play the Nationals a lot over the final two weeks of regular season play.\" Why is this necessary? Continuing to muse about sweet nothings while Miami has two runners on base representing the tying runs, Caray says of Harang, \"Can you imagine where this team would be without him?\" \"Yes,\" Simpson says. \"Third place.\" It's his best line of the night. Garrett Jones grounds into a double play to end the inning, but the Marlins get to Harang for a pair of runs the following inning to make it a 2-2 game. WILD FINISH The game remains tied into the ninth inning, when Craig Kimbrel comes out of the Atlanta bullpen since there can be no save situation in a tie game for the home team. Simpson calls a 99 mph fastball low and on the outside corner to Jones \"unhittable,\" which is a neat thing to say, but patently untrue. Jones just didn't swing at it, and struck out looking. Marcell Ozuna does swing, at a pitch that actually is unhittable, because Kimbrel's slider bounces in the opposite batter's box, and off Evan Gattis' shinguard. The wild pitch allows Ozuna to reach first base despite his strikeout. Another wild pitch moves Ozuna down to second base, which leads Simpson to plaintively lament, \"Like you said, nothing's been coming easy. Or it just seems that way, I guess.\" Here's Caray's call of the next pitch: \"Promptly, a single into center field. Late break by Ozuna, they're gonna bring him home. Upton's throw toward the plate — is on line, but late! And the wild pitch — not one, really, but two in the inning, cost the Braves dearly. An RBI single for Saltalamacchia gives Miami a 3-2 lead.\" \"I thought when Ozuna froze, and may have taken a step back to second base, in case the line drive was gonna be caught, that they may have a shot at him,\" Simpson says. \"He froze, looked — he didn't actually take a step back, but he waited until the ball cleared. B.J. got it in as fast as he could, made an accurate throw, just too late.\" Simpson has added nothing to Caray's information at all. Instead, he goes on to moan about the go-ahead run being scored by a batter who struck out. Yes, that is a thing that can happen in baseball. In fact, it just did, and when the Braves go three up, three down against Steve Cishek in the bottom of the ninth, the Marlins have a victory on an all-important late run.

Vidal told reporters he was not interested in a move to Manchester, which has prompted manager Louis van Gaal make a move for highly-rated Turkish international Turan, who has been a target for Liverpool in recent seasons . The 27-year-old has been tipped to be replaced by Arsenal’s Santi Cazorla, however, his agent, Ahmet Bulut, insisted recently that his client was happy with Diego Simeone’s side and will not be making a move anywhere for the time being. However, that will not stop Manchester United and according to the Express , they will table a £32 million bid for the midfielder. The Turkish international has a £32m release clause in his contract and recently opted against leaving for Liverpool. Van Gaal is prepared to meet that as he looks to bolster his lacklustre midfield. The Dutchman has already snapped up Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw this summer, but knows there is much more to be done to put the club back on the grid. BONUS BALL: HERE’S A STAT YOU PROBABLY HAVEN’T HEARD BEFORE Turan won 47% of his duels in La Liga last season.

Unfortunately, while there are exceptions, most are an exercise in patience as their utterly transparent three-act structure quickly causes your eyes to glaze over.So, what makes a great explainer video? After years of both watching and producing these , I’ve come up with a few points on how to make the best explainer video.  They get to the point. William Shakespeare once said “Brevity is the soul of wit.” When it comes to explainers, no truer words have ever been spoken. With the rapidly atrophying attention spans of online-media consumers, it’s important to get viewers watching and taking in your message. A good explainer video says what people need to hear to become believers and leaves the finer details to your website. Related:  The Idiot's Guide to Making a Video for Your Business An example of a good, brief explainer video is  Brad Chmielewski’s  30-second Groupon spot. There is so much information communicated during its brief duration that it feels much longer than 30 seconds. They tell a story. Great explainer videos provide an abbreviated look at how a product, service or company works. But, they can also weave a great story with a plot, a goal and (depending on the script) key characters, obstacles or tragedies. The most engaging explainer videos, tell a tale that makes you care about whatever it is they’re trying to communicate. Related:  The 5 Types of Videos Startups Need to Stay in the Game One of the best examples of great storytelling in an explainer video is  No Child For Sale  by Andrew Davies. We’re introduced to two young children who are sent through various obstacles that include, working in mines, sweatshops and even the sex trade. The characters go through each trial leading up to the turning point, along with a host of actionable solutions for the viewer to help them in real life. It’s a sweet and powerful piece. They break the rules. It’s sad, but the majority of explainer videos have a rigid structure that makes them feel manufactured. You can almost always spot the lazy paint-by-number three-act structure from a mile away :  Problem > Turning Point > Solution > Call to action Don’t get me wrong. I’m not saying this is necessarily the “wrong” way to do this (see my previous example). All I’m saying is that this structure can sometimes bring out a rhythm that’s incredibly easy to recognize and gets annoying over time. The beats in the script are so measured out that you can guess what’s going to happen at the point it’s going to happen, right down to the language they use. “Wouldn’t it be great if…?”, “That’s why we created…”, “Well now you can!”, are all phrases you could easily put on a bingo card -- and probably make up the majority of second acts in explainer videos.  While it’s great to identify a problem your viewer can relate to and offer a solution, this can be done without treading down this familiar path over and over again. Related:  6 Tricks to Get More Eyeballs on Your Videos This piece, written by Chris Koseluk and edited and animated by me for  Causes.com , is a prime example of the problem-solution model really getting it right. The problems take a back seat to the solution, and we’re given a great overview of how the site works and what we can achieve with it. It’s slick, it’s informative, and it converts.   Some wonderful explainers can get away with avoiding these three key points but most employ one or more of them. What’s important to remember is that, along with trying to explain what somethign does, explainers are designed to convert viewers into customers, activists or supporters. The best ones tell a rich, thoughtful and engaging story -- or make us laugh and want to share them because they’re devilishly clever. The rest? They keep us occupied for at least five seconds before we move onto the next thing.

Some 45% of internet users age 65 or older now use Facebook, up from 35% who did so in late 2012. Women are also particularly likely to use Facebook compared with men. Some 18% of online adults currently use Twitter, statistically similar to the 16% who did so in 2012. As was the case in our previous surveys on Twitter use, adoption levels are particularly high among younger adults and African-Americans. Some 17% of online adults use Instagram, up from 13% in late 2012. Two groups in particular have experienced a notable increase in Instagram usage in the last year. Instagram adoption by internet users ages 18-29 has increased from 28% in late 2012 to 37% in 2013, and adoption by African American internet users has increased from 23% to 34% over the same time period. Instagram was acquired by Facebook in April 2012. Some 21% of online adults use Pinterest, up from the 15% who did so in December 2012. Women continue to dominate the site: fully 33% of online women are Pinterest users, compared to just 8% of men. Pinterest users also skew slightly towards the affluent side – those in the highest income bracket are more likely than those in the lowest to use the site, as are those with a college degree or higher compared to those who have not attended college. Some 22% of online adults are LinkedIn users. As a platform geared towards professional networking, its user demographics are unique from the other sites discussed above.  Specifically, LinkedIn usage is especially high among people with a college degree or higher, and among those with an annual household income of $75,000 or more. It is also the only social networking site we measured for which usage among 50-64 year olds is higher than usage among those ages 18-29.

Two women, including the children's mother, were critically injured. \"Three innocent children had their lives taken,\" Homicide Capt. John Clark said. The accident occurred late Friday morning about a mile from where the carjacking occurred. Clark said the carjackers may have blown a tire as they turned a corner at high speed. The car ended up in a wooded area, its front end smashed against a stand of trees. \"Something obviously went horribly wrong,\" Clark said. The two dead brothers were ages 7 and 10, and their sister was 15. Police said their mother, 34, was in extremely critical condition. Their identities weren't immediately released. The carjackers fled the scene on foot and remained at large. Also helping the children and their mother sell fruit was a neighbor, who also was struck. The neighbor, 65, was reported in stable condition, police said. Police said the carjacked woman, a 45-year-old real estate agent who was forced into the backseat of her SUV, also was critically injured. Police were offering a $60,000 reward for the carjackers' capture. They also asked businesses with surveillance cameras to provide footage and asked anyone with information in the case to come forward. Witness Renee Charleston said she saw a car streaking through the intersection, then noticed children on the ground. \"Nobody was moving,\" she told television station WPVI. Employees at Education Works, an educational nonprofit across the street from the site of the wreck, told The Philadelphia Inquirer that they ran to try to help the victims. One boy had no pulse and another's was barely there, said Karen Payne, who runs a summer camp at the nonprofit. \"I'm certified in first aid and CPR — my first instinct was to go to them,\" she said. \"But I couldn't help.\" Deputy Mayor Everett Gillison said the mayor was heartbroken. \"The prayers of the city go out to this family,\" he said.

Although nothing has been formally signed, TMZ’s report says that Lil Wayne’s new company will “handle Ronaldo’s sports management affairs in the United States, everything from branding to marketing and endorsement deals. Even modeling.” (“Even” modeling? That seems more like a given.) The partnership would make a lot of sense. The two global superstars are considered good friends, and Lil Wayne’s company will reportedly work with PolarisSports — affiliated with GestiFute and CAA — through which Ronaldo’s agent Jorge Mendes currently operates.

All of us at Monolith Productions are extremely excited to announce that the Wraith is the greatest smith of Middle-earth’s Second Age, the Elf-lord Celebrimbor. Celebrimbor’s impact on Middle-earth is momentous. His skilled hands forged the Rings of Power. Celebrimbor was once a genuine challenger to The Dark Lord, and still wields the power to vanquish Sauron, especially after his defeat by The White Council at Dol Goldur. After all, they’ve met on the battlefield before, centuries prior to the events of Shadow of Mordor. Celebrimbor’s tale is one that we knew needed to be told. His moral pedigree is far from black and white. His downfall was terrible, and driven by pride. And, that’s only scratching the surface. Dig deeper with us, won’t you?

Jason Wambsgans Darren Foggey Jr. was a casualty in an ongoing conflict between groups of kids that live on either side of Western Avenue, according to police.  Just a week earlier, police had shot at someone who was shooting from 68th Street across Western Avenue toward rivals on the other side. They gave chase and fired a shot when one of the three people who fled turned a gun on police. One of the three eluded capture and police never found a gun.  Police also say a woman shot to death on 68th Street the evening of July 7 while walking with friends was tied to the conflict as a possible combatant. The shooting Wednesday night followed a day of conflict, according to a neighbor. First, a group of kids from the other side of Western ran up in the apartment building where ended up dying. Later one, two of them rode over on bikes and shot at a boy who lives on Artesian south of 69th Street, but missed.  “What gets me is how comfortable these kids are,” Debra Lewis said. Comfortable. Nonchalant Like it’s natural on a warm summer day to roll slow down a street and let a few shots go toward a sworn enemy, then pedal back toward the safety of their side of Western Avenue. Both times, neighbors called police. Officers lined up the boys the first time, searched them, but let them go, Debra Lewis said. The second time, the boys disappeared before police arrived. Then Foggey Jr. was shot. A single shot, into the apartment. Everyone inside dropped but Foggey Jr. was shot through the neck and died inside. Police said he may have been sitting on a radiator near a window at the time, and would have presented an easy target from the street below.  On Friday, Foggey said his son was shot by people he knew, who he was fighting with earlier in the day. “He liked baseball and basketball, video games and cooking,’’ said Foggey. Darren preferred to spend more time with his friends than his father. “He was a good kid,’’ said Foggey Sr. “He was true to himself.’’", "score"=>169.33043, "summaryTitle"=>"Scene of the crime: 16-year-old killed after day of neighborhood conflict", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Scene of the crime: 16-year-old killed after day of neighborhood conflict", "cities"=>"us-il-chicago", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://apps.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-scene-of-the-crime-16yearold-killed-after-day-of-neighborhood-conflict-20140725/", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1t5WAfb", "lastseen"=>"20140726004512", "page"=>"http://apps.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-scene-of-the-crime-16yearold-killed-after-day-of-neighborhood-conflict-20140725/", "ogtitle"=>"Scene of the crime: 16-year-old killed after day of neighborhood conflict -- Chicago Tribune"}, {"domain"=>"espncricinfo.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406316614000", "h2"=>"CAPTION CONTEST", "h3"=>["MORE IN CAPTION CONTEST", "DOPPELGANGERS", "GAMES"], "site"=>"www.espncricinfo.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140725235512", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406332512872", "title"=>"The Stands : Caption contest: 'Paint me like one of your French ladies' | ESPN Cricinfo", "initial"=>"20140725193014", "summaryText"=>"© Getty Images \"This won't be a wasted trip.

So…Dexter isn’t real Tranquilizer darts or gas that knock a person out instantly, rendering them safely unconscious for a few hours? Not a thing. All you’ll get from trying that in real life is death, comas, brain damage and sadness. Keeping someone safely unconscious is a dangerous process with little margin for error. There’s a good reason that anesthesiologists are so highly paid. 4. Welp If you’re in highschool at the moment, the majority of your friends won’t even be your acquaintances in the next 6 years. 5. That’s why my life’s so easy Life is so much easier / better if you have good looks. 6. Animals do some good for once Zombies can’t exist. they have too many natural predators (i.e. birds, maggots, insects). Any form of weather is bad weather for them without a regulatory system to maintain temperature (hot days their flesh goes rancid and falls off until they are bone, cold days they literally freeze). At most a zombie outbreak would last a few days. 7. Internet tribalism, we’re already there Lots of people mistakenly believe the internet represents a fair and accurate cross section of a country’s demographic. This is absolutely false, and one of the biggest reasons why society is becoming increasingly fractured and atomised, where everybody seems to be living inside their own bubble. Old people are underrepresented on the internet, as are poor people, as are politically conservative people, as are non-English speakers, as are people from warmer climates. It’s frighteningly easy to curate your own existence and beliefs online. Social media has a big role to play. You get to pick and chose who you follow, you decide what news you see on Twitter, you decides what subreddits you join, you decide your friendship circle on Facebook. I feel this is going to help cause some problems down the road. 8. Oh… Those videos of kittens that fall over adorably when someone pretends to shoot them? Yeah that’s a congenital defect. Almost every single cat you’ve seen in those videos is dead now because of it. 9. Especially when you fight Growlithe with Growlithe Pokemon is kinda like simulated dog fighting for kids. 10. A literal asshole fact The anus has a relatively high concentration of nerve endings and is an erogenous zone, which can make anal intercourse pleasurable for both the insertive partner and the receptive partner. Sigmund Freud’s theory of psychosexual development, for example, described an anal stage, hypothesizing that toddlers derive pleasure from retaining and expelling feces. This is the source of the term “anal-retentive” and the derived, derogatory vulgarism “anal”. 11. ALL ANIMALS RAPE?! >:( Male koalas rape. A lot. 12. Aw man :( When you die, very likely you will suffer at least a little bit. The best you can realistically hope for is a brief time when you are conscious as you asphyxiate. To put it another way, it takes about the same time to die like that as it does to drown. That’s if you’re lucky. Many, many people suffer for hours/days/weeks/months and even years before they pop the twig. The concept of dying peacefully in your sleep is a very few and far between occurrence. 13. So the machine chooses I was a slot technician in a casino for years. I’d have customers go into a bonus where they had to choose a box or item for their bonus. They’d often ask me which one to choose. I always replied “Do you want me to ruin it for you?”. Truth is, no matter what you pick, it is already determined what the outcome will be. If the machine is going to show you that you win $7, it doesn’t matter what box you pick on the screen. Technically, they are ALL $7. 14. Invisible woman was a fake, I knew it Being invisible wouldn’t be awesome because you would be blind the second you went invisible. If your eyes are invisible the light has nothing to bounce back to rendering you unable to see. 15. We create emotional bonds over fake characters than with dying children??? People get more upset and saddened by the deaths of fictional characters then they do by thousands of dead children in the third world each day. 16. WHAT?! Eating a banana gives you a higher dose of radiation than living within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant for 1 year. 17. We give and take Everyone you have known has used you in some way shape or form to further their own interests. Even your mother. 18. SO YOU’RE TELLING ME I SPENT AN ENTIRE SATURDAY IN VAIN? Cash cab is half a farce like any other reality tv show. You apply to be on a tv show about New York restaurants and have to pass a 10 question quiz. If you get picked for the show they send you to location 1 and tell you a cab will pick you up and bring you to location 2. When you get into the cab, DING DING DING, it’s the cash cab. TL;DR You’re not going to hail the cash cab. 19. Thanks, asshole When people say “you eat like a bird” respond with “birds actually eat twice their body weight.” 20.

And that’s awesome. Earning your degree is something that should be celebrated. But unless you are looking for certain technical skills,", "content"=>"July 25, 2014 This year you may have attended a graduation party or two or even have recently had one of your own. And that’s awesome. Earning your degree is something that should be celebrated. But unless you are looking for certain technical skills, college is not always the best place for entrepreneurs. That’s not to say that you shouldn’t attend college. It may even be a great place to start a business . It just that educational institutions aren’t known for teaching essential startup techniques. To fill the gap, here are 10 startup lessons that I never learned in college: 1. How to handle failure.  An inevitable part of the startup experience is tasting failure. Almost all successful entrepreneurs have failed at one point or other. It’s a learning process that can help you make your next venture a success. But you won’t learn about this in college. After all, colleges want you to succeed. They want you to graduate and become an esteemed alumni who donates money. Colleges don’t prepare you for not passing a class or landing a job after graduating.They don’t prep you for failure. Truth is, it’s not the end of the world. This is something that you will have to discover and cope with when joining the startup world. 2. How to raise money. Relatively speaking, raising money for college is a cinch compared with funding a new business. While some people rely on parental support, others pursue loans and grants.   But raising money for a startup is infinitely more complex in its paperwork. Investors and banks expect you to present a detailed business plan that describes how a product works and how it will eventually make them a little something extra. You may have to negotiate with investors and banks if they don’t at first understand your vision -- something else that you won’t acquire in college.  3. How to budget.   In college you probably did not handle considerable sums of money. You lived off student loans, a part-time job or credit cards -- not taxes, payroll, business expenses or office rent. If you had  extra cash, you savored it, even if that meant living off Ramen Noodles for the next two weeks. You really did not have to budget your money. Just try to do that with a startup. Being able to read and understand a profit-and-loss statement or balance sheet is vital. You will have to be able to budget expenses for the next six months, a year or longer --  skills you may not have picked up in a college lecture hall. 4. It’s acceptable to pivot. College students often change majors and transfer to another school. That's not something widely advertised. But, in fact,  61 percent of students switch their major  by the close of sophomore year at the University of Florida, according to The New York Times.  And pivoting is something that startups are becoming familiar with.   5. Thinking outside of the box. Often in school, there’s a right and wrong answer. But in the startup world, ambiguity rules.   “If you are not prepared to be wrong, you will never come up with anything original,\" author and educator Ken Robinson declared in a TED talk, “ Schools Kill Creativity,”  which has been /viewed almost 27 million times. 6. How to build the right network. Connecting with people in college is not the same as engaging with people in the real world. A drinking buddy or roommate who may have been so crucial to you in college won't matter so much as you try to get a startup off the ground. No matter how tempting it may be to hire friends, they may not be right for your startup. If you majored in business, though, how often do you cross paths with an awesome programmer? Probably never.  When running a startup, be ready and willing to reach out and engage with the right people, instead of just relying on those who are there. With the right network of people, the possibilities are endless.   7. How to be a salesperson. If you want your startup to succeed, then you must sell. You’re going to have to market the company's product to employees, investors and clients. But did you ever take a \"Salesperson 101\" course in college? Being a top-notch salesperson isn’t hardly something that can be taught in a classroom. It’s a skill that must be refined over time through experience and that entails being able to read people well enough to get them hooked on your company's mission. 8. The importance of health. Although your college's cafeteria may have stocked nutritious food and included gyms and wellness seminars, your health may not have been a focal point back then. Instead, staying out all night and then skipping class was fine occasionally.   But at a startup, you and your employees will put a lot of hours and hard work. You just can’t call in sick because you have the sniffles.   Since every day at your startup matters, take note that the Centers for Disease Control has found that overall  healthy employees are more productive and call in sick less often .   9. How to be a boss. Some people are natural-born leaders. Others become great leaders in college, like that star quarterback. And still others take business classes that cover all sorts of theories for how to make a better businessperson. But being a boss -- that is, actually managing employees -- is something else entirely. While great bosses may also be great leaders, not all leaders make great bosses. When that quarterback leaves college, could he look the father of five directly in the eyes and fire him? Being a great boss means that you should be able to guide, inspire and even make tough decisions. There isn’t a class for that. It’s just another skill you’ll have to learn in the real world. 10. Time management. In college, because of the abundant stretches of free time, you could  enjoy leisure time and also make up for any goofing off. That won’t happen at a startup. There is no free time. You’re going to be working essentially 24/7, no matter how tired. So while your friends are enjoying happy hour, don’t become upset about finishing up a business plan, doing research or having a late-night meeting with employees. That’s just the nature of the beast.

I prefer playing fatter strings and guitars with this scale accept a starting string gauge of 10's in standard tuning better than long scale axes do IME. Plus, when going into a bright amplifier using a short scale guitar, the top end of it isn't harsh typically and that allows you to be able to use more treble at the amp for more cut and bite. 3. \"Pointy\" - The way a guitar looks is just as important to me as the actual things that make the guitar a guitar.

Zach apparently went a little wild during the ceremony and there was plenty of all out following the ceremony. We’ve got all those highlights for you. Find out what else happened on the Big Brother Feeds so far today in the house. Big Brother 16 Live Feed Highlights – Friday, July 25, 2014 : 8:14 AM BBT – Feeds cut. Wake-up time. 8:43 AM BBT – Feeds return. Donny seems to be the only one up, though. 9:35 AM BBT – Donny, Derrick and Frankie have a Team America meeting. The plan is to get Zach and Christine to fight at the nomination ceremony. 9:45 AM BBT – Frankie and Zach are practicing their speeches. Zach’s plan is to call out Christine as being a worthless floater. 10:16 AM BBT – Feeds cut. Nomination ceremony time. 11:44 AM BBT – Feeds return. Victoria is visibly upset. She went on the block as one of Frankie’s nominees. Elsewhere, Nicole is crying. She went up as one of Zach’s nominees. 11:45 AM BBT – Christine and Cody are talking and she thinks Zach is a saboteur (he nominated her as well). 11:51 AM BBT – Victoria is upset because Jocasta isn’t good at competitions and will hinder her chances of winning BOTB. So the nominees are Victoria/Jocasta and Christine/Nicole. 11:52 AM BBT – Frankie wants Amber to ask Jocasta to throw the BOTB because it’s too risky for Zach to be HOH. 11:55 AM BBT – Nicole, Christine and Hayden are talking about Zach being the saboteur and say his game is over after this. 12:01 PM BBT – Frankie and Derrick say they will not tell anyone they knew about Zach’s speech before hand. Talk turns to damage control with Christine and Nicole. 12:13 PM BBT – Victoria is still crying. She thinks she could be going home this week. She’s pretty mad at Frankie for putting her up again. 12:30 PM BBT – Cody tells Zach he needs to stop being so mean to people now. Zach says he wants people to hate him, but Cody says he doesn’t want Nicole and Christine coming after him. 12:34 PM BBT – Frankie tells Zach that if Christine and Nicole don’t win BOTB and are still on the block at veto or after, the house will come after him. Zach is confused (because they should still have the alliance support). Frankie attempts to cover, but the feeds cut. 12:36 PM BBT – Zach leaves to go eat food in front of the have-nots and Cody and Frankie call him a mess. Cody compares him to Evel Dick. Cody then tells Frankie most people want him to backdoor Zach this week. Frankie says Zach needs to win POV, use it on Victoria and then Amber can be backdoored. Frankie seems confident his noms will lose BOTB. 12:42 PM BBT – Frankie and Cody FINALLY say something that makes sense. If Zach remains HOH and backdoors someone it won’t be them and that’s what matters. 12:52 PM BBT – Victoria and Jocasta talking about BOTB. Victoria tells her they can’t lose just because the house wants Zach out as HOH. 12:57 PM BBT – Despite all the things Frankie says about Zach, he tells him he’s falling in love with him as they’re spooning in the HOH bed. 1:00 PM BBT – Victoria says America must be so bored with the same people going up every week. 1:13 PM BBT – Cody says if he wins veto, he’s taking Christine off the block. 1:33 PM BBT – Amber is irritated and telling Cody he. Frankie and Derrick are sitting pretty and haven’t had to go on the block. He’s not responding. 1:45 PM BBT – Fun is over for now. All HGs napping and resting up for BOTB.   At this point, anything can happen. People are scrambling in the house. I wouldn’t dare say what I think is going to happen this week.You can watch all of these Big Brother 16 events using the archives flashback , the DVR-like feature of this year’s Live Feeds which means it’s always live, even when you missed it!

Under the combined effects of storms, development, and sea-level rise, portions of this narrow, 200-mile island chain are collapsing, says Stanley Riggs , a coastal geologist at East Carolina University in Greenville. \"We're losing them right now,\" he says. \"In the next ten years, it's going to be awful.\" In an area of Hatteras Island between Avon and Buxton, the beach has receded about 2,500 feet in the past 150 years. That portion of the island has narrowed to just 25 percent of its original width, according to Riggs. In Buxton and Rodanthe, and farther north in Nags Head, houses and hotels once solidly on land stand on spindly stilts in the surf. State Highway 12, the only road to Hatteras Island, repeatedly has buckled and washed out during storms. It briefly closed after Hurricane Arthur made landfall July 3. The erosion is set to worsen as sea-level rise accelerates around the world because of global warming. (Read \" Rising Seas \" in National Geographic magazine.) As that happens, coastal communities everywhere will face the same wrenching decisions that confront Outer Banks inhabitants today—and that are causing enormous fear there, says Michael Orbach , professor emeritus of marine policy at Duke University's marine lab in Beaufort, North Carolina. What's at stake for locals is not just summer fun but a way of life and an entire economy that is now based on tourism. \"All these effects that people have been talking about for years are now actually starting to be seen,\" Orbach says. \"And they realize that we don't know what to do about it.\" In Focus Video: What If Your Home Was Slipping Into the Ocean?   A Prediction, Then a Backlash Riggs has been studying the state's coastline since 1967, when he got a job at East Carolina University to start a coastal and marine science program in an unused building on Roanoke Island. In 2010, he was a member of a science panel that produced a controversial report warning that North Carolina could face 39 inches (1 meter) of sea-level rise by 2100, as glaciers melt and ocean waters warm and expand.   The report prompted a backlash from coastal developers and climate skeptics—and in 2012, from the state. Lawmakers in Raleigh considered a bill that would have prohibited state agencies from planning for accelerated sea-level rise. Environmentalists were outraged, bloggers snickered, and even comedian Stephen Colbert weighed in : \"If your science gives you a result you don't like, pass a law saying the result is illegal,\" he joked. \"Problem solved.\" Eventually, the state settled on a watered-down version of the law: a four-year moratorium on sea-level regulations, and an order for a new scientific study of sea-level rise, due out in 2015. In May, a state commission asked the science panel to limit its next sea-level forecast to 30 years. The irony of the whole argument, Riggs says, is that the coast as we know it is already vanishing. \"Sea-level rise and storms are taking out eastern North Carolina today—not a hundred years from now. They're doing it today,\" he says. Two other scientists who have studied North Carolina's coast, Orrin Pilkey , an emeritus professor of Earth sciences at Duke University in Durham, and Rob Young , director of a shoreline research program at Duke and Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, agree that the islands are undergoing significant changes. \"Portions of the Outer Banks, particularly Hatteras Island, are in big, big trouble right now,\" says Young, who was also a member of the sea-level science panel. \"That barrier island is falling apart.\" As barrier islands, the Outer Banks experience the natural process of shifting sands, which creates inlets.

In 1999 the lighthouse was relocated to a safer location. \"Critical Condition\" One evening in late June, Carol Dawson, owner of the Cape Hatteras Motel in Buxton, on Hatteras Island, gazed out at the surf from her motel balcony. Over the years, she has watched the ocean eat closer to her buildings. \"Our property line is about where that wave is cresting,\" she says, gesturing toward a point about 500 feet out in the water. At the motel next door, owned by Dawson's mother, children capered on sandbags piled on what remains of the beach. Every few minutes, a wave washed around the sandbags and under the steps of the motel units closest to the water. Dawson says repeated closures of State Highway 12 have hurt business on Hatteras Island. As the ocean edges closer to her motel, Dawson says her business is in critical condition. In 2012, according to the U.S. Travel Association , tourism generated $926 million just in Dare County, which includes most of Hatteras Island, Kitty Hawk, and the town of Nags Head. Summer visitors swell the population of Nags Head from 3,000 to 60,000. \"Our only industry is the tourist industry, and without a beach there is no tourist industry,\" says Nags Head Mayor Bob Edwards. Shifting Sands People often describe the Outer Banks as fragile, but the sandy islands are remarkably resilient, at least in the natural course of things. Just as engineers design buildings in earthquake zones to sway with the movements of the Earth, barrier islands move in response to storms and sea-level rise. During the last ice age, 20,000 years ago, so much water was locked up in continental ice sheets that sea level was 410 feet lower than it is today, and the Atlantic coastline was 15 to 40 miles east of the present-day Outer Banks, according to a book Riggs co-authored, The Battle for North Carolina's Coast: Evolutionary History, Present Crisis, and Vision for the Future . Barrier islands formed off North Carolina's coast at least 7,000 years ago, after most of the ice had melted. Over the millennia, as sea-level rise continued at a slower pace, the islands and the sound behind them moved landward. They began forming in their current location 2,000 to 3,000 years ago, when the sea all but stopped rising. Since 1900, it's been rising again at an accelerated pace, due in large part, climate scientists say, to man-made global warming. In principle, the islands should be migrating west. The mechanism works like this: From time to time, storms slice new inlets through the islands. Seawater rushes through, depositing sand behind them. Meanwhile, waves and wind push sand across the top of the islands. As the ocean side erodes and the sound side grows, the islands slowly roll over themselves, like a bulldozer's tread. Or at least they would if the same development that transformed the Outer Banks into a vacation wonderland hadn't jammed the machinery of island migration. Before World War II, the people who lived in the islands' fishing communities built their houses on high ground, far from the ocean's edge, and traveled by boat. That started to change in the 1950s, when paving began on State Highway 12. To protect the road from storms, workers piled sand east of the highway on artificial dunes first built in the 1930s. When storms carved inlets through the road, engineers filled them. The dune-building and inlet-filling blocked the movement of sand across the islands. On the ocean side, the islands kept eroding, but now they didn't grow on the sound side. So they narrowed. Other engineering projects meant to protect human activities, such as dredging and building hard structures called jetties and groins, made erosion worse, Riggs says. Even so, the road brought tourists, and a new economy developed around beachfront rental homes, hotels, and stores. The permanent population of Dare County, about 35,000, is six times as large today as it was in 1950—and the residents all have a stake in preserving the islands where they are. The ultimate fate of the islands depends on how quickly the rise in sea level accelerates in the coming decades and how many major hurricanes slam the islands. Riggs predicts the lowest, narrowest islands could break up into a system of small, eroded island remnants and shoals. Without human interference, the islands would adapt to accelerating sea-level rise by migrating west, says Duke's Pilkey. Instead, because of engineering projects, they're \"standing perfectly still, and we're beating our head against the wall trying to hold those shorelines in place.\" Will we succeed? \"No, of course not.\" To Stay or to Go? Riggs has proposed that the state remove portions of State Highway 12 and stop maintaining the large dunes that protect it. Withdrawing the road and dunes would allow sand to wash over the islands and rebuild them. In his view, tourists could travel by ferry, like those that connect people to Ocracoke and Bald Head Islands today. The idea doesn't appeal to locals, who say ferries couldn't keep pace with the number of visitors who want access to the islands. \"It's not 1950,\" says Dawson, the motel owner. She's in favor of shoring up narrowing beaches with sand delivered from elsewhere. The town of Nags Head completed a $36 million \"beach nourishment project\" in 2011, paid for with local taxes. Edwards, the mayor of Nags Head, says nourishment protected the tourism industry and buffered the town during Hurricane Sandy . According to a survey conducted in June by the contracting company that completed the Nags Head project, 97 percent of the sand from the project still remains. But Nags Head may be an outlier; Riggs says other beach nourishment projects in the state lasted only two or three years. Beach nourishment isn't a long-term solution, says Orbach, the marine policy specialist, because there isn't enough sand to go around for all of the communities on the Atlantic Coast that will want it in the next 50 years. \"As a practical matter, we will try to defend some places for some period of time,\" he says. \"But also as a practical matter, we will not be able to defend most coastal places throughout time. We will, in fact, retreat from most coastal places when the sea level gets more than one or two meters above where it is now.\" For Hatteras residents such as Ernie Foster, 69, a charter-boat captain, retreat would mean more than packing a moving van. Foster's great-grandparents and grandparents were born on the Outer Banks. When Hurricane Arthur came through in early July, he stayed home, despite a mandatory evacuation order.

Asked how he would feel about leaving Hatteras, Foster's eyes well up. \"My family cemetery, down behind the home that I grew up in, is one in which my grandfather and my father and mother and some uncles and aunts are buried, and I will be buried there as well,\" Foster says. \"When the island washes away, I'll just go with it.\" Eileen Mignoni contributed reporting.

Some couples invite everyone they’ve ever known, and some couples invite very few people. My fiancé and I decided to invite everyone who had ever made an impact on our lives, big or small. Given that I met my soon-to-be husband in law school, I decided that I wanted to invite a Supreme Court justice to our wedding — but not any Supreme Court justice. To stay true to the way we invited all of our guests, I wanted to invite the justice who made the biggest impact on my life. I sent an invitation to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and painstakingly sealed it with a rhinestone heart. (Truth be told, it took three rhinestone hearts before I thought it looked as perfect as possible.) Inside of the invitation’s envelopment, I enclosed a handwritten note, telling Justice Ginsburg what an inspirational woman she was and praising her for what she’s done for women’s rights in the United States. I didn’t think Justice Ginsburg would have the time to RSVP. After all, the recipient of my celebrity wedding invitation is one of the most important public figures alive in this country, and I’m just a law school graduate who writes for a legal website (albeit the most well-known legal website in the country). Shame on me for thinking Justice Ginsburg — or the Notorious R.B.G., as we so lovingly call her — would let me down when it came to our wedding… With just a week until RSVPs were due, I received a response from my favorite justice (click to enlarge): Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, you made my day — if not my life — with this letter. Thank you so very much for making me smile, and thank you again for all of the good that you do in the world. P.S. A Supreme Court justice took the time to respond to our wedding invitation, and yet we still have 50+ outstanding RSVPs.

In a July 21 NRA News video titled \"Everyone Gets A Gun,\" NRA News commentator Billy Johnson imagined a compulsory education system that would require children to become proficient with firearms, just like \"reading and writing,\" even \"if they didn't want to learn\" as a requirement to advance in school: JOHNSON: Gun policy driven by our need for guns would insist that we introduce young people to guns early and that we'd give them the skills to use firearms safely. Just like we teach them reading and writing, necessary skills. We would teach shooting and firearm competency. It wouldn't matter if a child's parents weren't good at it. We'd find them a mentor. It wouldn't matter if they didn't want to learn. We would make it necessary to advance to the next grade. Johnson's suggestion children would have to become proficient with a gun to move on in school was widely ridiculed . Now the NRA is responding to critics with the misleading suggestion that Johnson was merely talking about the importance of teaching children gun safety. Johnson appeared on the July 24 edition of NRA News' Cam & Company on The Sportsman Channel to defend his video. Host Cam Edwards started the conversation by saying, \"One of the things that specifically the anti-gunners are flipping out about is [Johnson's] suggestion that if we had a national gun policy, that again, embraced our right to keep and bear arms, one of the things we might be talking about is educating kids about how to be safe and responsible with a firearm, regardless of whether or not their parents were gun owners. That thought ... has really got people on the anti-gun side of the equation freaked out. They're saying that you're demanding compulsory education of firearms training for kids, they are wondering why on earth any child would need to know how to be safe and responsible with a firearm and I find it fascinating because they're ignoring the fact that there are already hundreds of thousands of kids across this country who are safely and responsibly learning about firearms.\" But critics of the NRA video were saying that it promoted the idea of mandatory firearms training because in the video Johnson says, \"We would make it necessary to advance to the next grade.\" Johnson also offered misleading commentary on his video, suggesting that he was being called \"radical\" for talking about teaching kids \"what they should do if they do find a gun\": JOHNSON: I think education is important. I think you need to teach your kids, whether or not you're a gun owner yourself, what they should do if they do find a gun, if they are confronted with a gun, on what's the right thing to do. And you know how that's so radical is beyond me to comprehend. However in his commentary video, Johnson said he was talking about \"firearms safety,\" but also \"shooting and firearm competency\" that would be required to advance to the next grade. Edwards ended the segment by showing \"a portion of this commentary clip so you know what it is that the anti-gun folks are actually freaking out about.\" Unfortunately NRA News cut the video just before the most controversial part of his commentary, where Johnson said: \"Just like we teach them reading and writing, necessary skills. We would teach shooting and firearm competency. It wouldn't matter if a child's parents weren't good at it. We'd find them a mentor. It wouldn't matter if they didn't want to learn.

Seven days later a plane crashed in Taiwan (above), and on the eighth day another flight went down <B>en</B>", "content"=>"25 July 2014 Last updated at 09:23 ET By Alison Gee BBC News Magazine In the space of eight days, three passenger planes have been lost in mid-flight. A cluster of accidents so close together may seem an unlikely coincidence but is it? The first accident happened on Thursday 17 July, when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 fell from the sky over eastern Ukraine, apparently brought down by a missile. Seven days later a plane crashed in Taiwan (above), and on the eighth day another flight went down en route to Algeria from Burkina Faso. In all, 462 people are thought to have died. Some people may suddenly be wondering how safe it is to fly. But Harro Ranter, director of the Aviation Safety Network which catalogues plane crashes, says clusters of accidents are not unusual. Analysing the number and frequency of fatal crashes of aircraft capable of carrying 14 or more passengers since 1990, he finds 45 dates when there have been two or more crashes (excluding collisions). In 105 cases there have been accidents on consecutive days. In fact, Ranter says it is more common for an accident to happen just one day after another crash than two, three or more days later. Why might this be? \"It is essentially a coincidence, except for the technicality that adverse weather involving thunderstorms and typhoons is more common in some seasons than others,\" says Arnold Barnett, a Professor of Statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. However, Barnett also draws attention to the theory of Poisson distribution, which implies that short intervals between crashes are actually more probable than long ones. \"Suppose that there is an average of one fatal accident per year, meaning that the chance of a crash on any given day is one in 365,\" says Barnett. \"If there is a crash on 1 August, the chance that the next crash occurs one day later on 2 August is 1/365. But the chance the next crash is on 3 August is (364/365) x (1/365), because the next crash occurs on 3 August only if there is no crash on 2 August.\" As each day passes, the likelihood of a fatal accident falls. \"It seems counterintuitive, but the conclusion follows relentlessly from the laws of probability,\" Barnett says. About 500 passengers die in crashes involving scheduled commercial flights each year, and although that number has already been exceeded in 2014 - by about 200 - we should not expect the coming months to have an unusually high number of accidents. Barnett points out that during April, May and June this year, there were no fatal accidents at all involving scheduled commercial flights. \"It is hard to imagine that the skill that led to this marvellous record somehow disappeared in July,\" he says. He calculates that in developed countries the chance of dying is about one in 25 million per flight. \"A child at a UK airport is more likely to grow up to be prime minister than perish on the forthcoming flight... the child is more likely to win an Olympic gold medal or receive the Nobel prize in physics.\" Even in the world's least developed countries the chance of dying on a flight is about one in 750,000. As for the occurrence of three fatal crashes in eight days, David Spiegelhalter, Professor for the Public Understanding of Risk at Cambridge University, has worked out that there is about a six in 10 chance that we should see such a large cluster during a 10-year period, and \"the most likely maximum number of crashes of commercial planes with over 18 passengers in any eight-day window over 10 years is exactly three\".

SAN ANTONIO -- San Antonio Park Police arrested 47-year-old Jerry Ellis Jr. Thursday, after undercover officers said he pleasured himself in a wooded area near the main road of McAllister Park. Ellis approached an officer in plain clothes in a men's restroom, then walked with the officer to the wooded area near a park bike trail and began rubbing his genitals \"in a back and forth motion\". Ellis' arrest came approximately 90 minutes after SAPD received a similar call for man seen \"pleasuring himself\" while leaning on a picnic table. In that incident, a woman walking a dog said she witnessed the act in progress, then quickly alerted police. The woman told the I-Team it was the second time in as many months she witnessed the same man performing a lewd act in McAllister Park. \"You always hear rumblings sometimes of things that aren't necessarily the best that can go on in parks,\" said Glenna Pearce, who was at the park Friday with her young son. SAPD records indicate officers have responded to 63 calls at McAllister Park since April 1. A woman called SAPD Thursday, to report a man \"pleasuring himself\" on a picnic table in McAllister Park. (Photo: Jason Gonzales) The calls for service log did not indicate the exact nature of each call. Parents KENS 5 spoke with Friday said Ellis' arrest would not keep them from returning to the popular park. \"Look at my surroundings beforehand, try to gauge.

Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program .” —Agent Smith, The Matrix “ Machines were, it may be said, the weapon employed by the capitalists to quell the revolt of specialized labor. ” —Karl Marx, The Poverty of Philosophy “ Dwight and I are the cornerstones of the Rockets. The rest of the guys are role players or pieces that complete our team .” —James Harden Even as basketball becomes smarter, more strategic, more data-driven, and more rational, some things remain unquantifiable, unpredictable, and immutable. And this is why we watch, right? We watch for the beauty of the game, for great players expressing their greatness, and for the lesser players playing selflessly. We watch for smartly built teams of great and lesser players playing the right way. But also, and I think just as importantly, we watch because best-laid plans fall apart, because playing chess against checkers is all well and good until the pawn objects to its station. And we watch because, every now and again, there is beef. Wonderful, delicious beef. Allow me to quickly walk you through the latest, freshest, grass-fed bone-in steak’s journey from the pasture to your table. Chandler Parsons, late of the Houston Rockets and now loudly and proudly a Dallas Maverick, was quoted in a story saying that he was “offended”  by the way Houston handled his restricted free agency and that he could have been, in effect, the third star the team was looking for. A few days later, Dwight Howard, when asked to comment on the loss of Parsons, responded with, “It won’t affect us at all.”  Then, on Thursday, James Harden was quoted, while in the Philippines, as saying that all Rockets players not named Harden and Howard are essentially replaceable . Chandler then responded, in what I can only assume is a Hunt for Red October– level subtweet: All of which is to say that Rockets-Mavs will be one of the must-watch fixtures of the upcoming season. Not because of deft salary-cap management or smart player evaluation. Well, maybe a little because of those things. But mostly because of the intersection of logical progress and human ambition. There is an inescapable logic to math, as well as progress. Systems are created, develop, and over time become more efficient or get pushed aside. Take, for instance, the development of real-time positioning technologies and their effects on workplaces, sports included. It simply makes sense that once the technology to track NBA players became available, teams would use those technologies to dispassionately analyze the way their players interact with each other on the court. Similarly, it just makes sense that, as the ability to track people at work and to categorize and log all of their interactions becomes more accessible to employers in every marketplace, the practice will become  the norm. That’s progress, that’s math. But, project yourself into that workplace, monitored at all times by a smart sensor in your name tag. Your bathroom breaks meticulously logged, the number and duration of your very bodily functions reduced to digital blips. Progress suddenly becomes as oppressive as the authority of an officer leading a chain gang. Human beings, especially twentysomethings, have ambitions, and those ambitions will always seek to move away from an outside power defining them as a cog. Sure, someone has to be the cog. But consider this: Almost every free agent to ever hit the market has expressed some variation of, “It’s just nice to feel wanted.” You can’t really argue with the cold logic of Harden and Howard’s point of view. Harden is exactly right in his assessment of his and Dwight’s place in the Rockets hierarchy. General manager Daryl Morey’s gambit to sign a third superstar, and to re-sign Parsons using Bird rights, is a perfectly sound strategy, if perhaps not so gracefully executed. Morey not matching the Mavericks’ three-year, $46 million deal — a deal that will launch Parsons into the top 30 of yearly salaries — for a player who averaged 16.6 points, 5.5 rebounds, and four assists with a 15.9 PER is just math, plain and simple. “That structure of that [contract] is literally one of the most untradeable structures that I’ve ever seen. That’s why it came down to a bet of Harden, Howard and Parsons being the final piece, because we would have had no ability to do anything after that,” said Morey . One of the most oft-repeated anecdotes in sports history is the semi-apocryphal tale of a young Michael Jordan getting cut from his high school basketball team. MJ used that slight as fuel to a fire that ended up devouring nearly all of the 1990s. Jordan’s then coach, Clifton Herring, actually sent MJ to the junior varsity team. It wasn’t because of his ability, it was because his team lacked height and Jordan was only 5-foot-10. Simple math. It goes without saying that Chandler Parsons is not Michael Jordan. It also misses the point. After all, Michael Jordan wasn’t even “Michael Jordan” in high school. Both instances are examples of a player rejecting an outside formulation of what they are. That human sentiment, to be more than the judgments of others, no matter how unrealistic, is what makes “Nobody believes in us” an evergreen sports team rallying cry. Chandler Parsons is not a superstar player. But sports would be pretty boring if guys like him just accepted what the numbers say they are. ♦ ♦ ♦ And now, a special postscript from Grantland’s Chandler Parsons correspondent, Juliet Litman: This is as good as it gets for Chandler Parsons. He has been in the news basically since mid-June, when his free agency was just a possibility. Since then he’s been a hot-button issue, he has been valued at $15 million per year, and he recorded an epic, if now mythical, club video . Right now his talent and potential are abstract concepts that have been valued very highly. Thank you, James Harden, for prolonging the Summer of Chandler. The best thing about all of this is that we (I) can now comfortably hate Houston without betraying my one true NBA love. Dwight Howard is an overgrown child without a winner’s mentality. Harden is not fun to watch (though I do enjoy watching him beef). Kevin McHale is a shitty coach.

It’ll be a tough roster to crack with 19 returning starters, a few key free agent acquisitions, a number of solid reserves and a full crop of draft picks all vying for 53 spots. Tight end Joseph Fauria and right tackle LaAdrian Waddle proved themselves a season ago, however, and there is always room for sleepers who come in and make plays. So, who has a chance to be this year’s Fauria and Waddle? Cornelius Lucas , T, 6-9, 328 Lucas wasn’t able to fully participate in spring workouts as he recovered from a stress fracture in his foot. He believes questions about his health are the reason he wasn’t drafted in the first place. Lucas will be ready to go on Monday and no one will be able to miss his 6-foot-9 frame. The Lions made him a priority free agent signing after the draft and love his potential with that big frame and athleticism. “He had 26 straight starts at Kansas State,” Lions general manager Martin Mayhew said of Lucas this offseason . “We think he has a chance to be like a Waddle sort of guy. We’re going to try him at left and right tackle. The guy was productive (at Kansas State).” The Lions have an opening for a fourth tackle behind Riley Reiff , LaAdrian Waddle and Corey Hilliard . Lucas has a good shot to make the 53. James Franklin , QB, 6-2, 230 Franklin is a big, athletic quarterback who brings a little different dimension to the Lions offense with his ability to run the football and get outside the pocket. Kellen Moore has been the Lions’ third quarterback the last two seasons, but this is a new coaching staff and there are no loyalties there. It’s unclear if the Lions will even keep three quarterbacks on the roster, but Franklin will be given every opportunity – along with Moore – to win that third spot in the preseason. The third quarterback runs the scout team in the regular season and Franklin’s ability to run and get outside of the pocket could help the Lions prepare to play the likes of Cam Newton and other versatile quarterbacks. That could play to his advantage as well. Chad Abram , FB, 6-0, 236 Jed Collins looks to be the favorite to win the Lions’ fullback role this season as a three-year professional with ties to offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi from their time together in New Orleans. If Abram is going to make the roster, he’ll have to let his athleticism shine through in camp. Abram is the fastest of the fullbacks and is probably the most explosive as a running back and receiver. There’s a lot more to playing fullback than that, however, especially in this offense. “Having a fullback will add a few different wrinkles that we didn’t have last year,” running backs coach Curtis Modkins said. “Fullback is a thinking man’s position. It’s not the old time every play is an iso or lead play. There’s some thinking and adjustments they have to make on the run … and I’m fortunate because we have some really sharp players.” If Abram proves he’s trustworthy, and lets his athleticism shine, he has a shot. Jerome Couplin , S, 6-2, 215 Note Couplin’s size. He’s a big safety with wide shoulders and will look even bigger when the pads come on next week. Can he cover and will he be in the right spots? Those are the biggest hurdles for rookie safeties, especially ones coming from a small school like William & Mary. He’s going to be good in the box, but he has to prove he can do everything else that comes with playing the position if he wants to beat out veteran Isa Abdul-Quddus and DeJon Gomes for that fourth safety spot behind Glover Quin , James Ihedigbo and Don Carey . Corey Fuller , WR, 6-2, 204 Fuller spent last season on the practice squad after the Lions drafted him as a raw prospect in the sixth round. The former track star turned receiver had to spend a season building up his strength and learning how to stay low in his route tree. He has good size and terrific speed and could find himself in the mix for one of the final outside receiver spots if he can make a few plays early in camp and catch a few eyes in the preseason.", "score"=>168.45215, "summaryTitle"=>"Five sleepers with a chance to make the roster&nbsp;", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Senior writer Tim Twentyman gives five sleepers a chance to make the roster.

When he couldn’t promise he wouldn’t do it again for another", "content"=>"Jul 23rd 2014, 18:07 by E.W. | WASHINGTON, DC FRANK SCHAEFER, a Methodist preacher in Pennsylvania, officiated at his son’s same-sex wedding in 2007. This act of sacrilege earned him a suspension. When he couldn’t promise he wouldn’t do it again for another same-sex couple, the United Methodist Church decided to defrock him last year. But in June the church went ahead and re-frocked him. A panel of judges decided it was unwise to punish the minister for something he had not yet done. Mr Schaefer now has plans to resume his pastoral work in Santa Barbara, California, ministering to college students. “One day we will celebrate the fact that we have moved beyond this horrible chapter in our church’s life,” he said. Same-sex marriage poses an existential problem for a number of religious groups in America. Now that these unions are legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia, faith-based leaders are left wondering how much they need to change with the times.  Though some are sympathetic to the needs of gay congregants, many pride themselves on their principled dissonance with popular culture. Indeed, not a few Methodists are appalled at the example set by Mr Schaefer. Reverend Rob Renfrone, president of Good News, a United Methodist organisation that opposes same-sex marriage, says that the decision to keep him in the fold “helps us see that maybe we are so different that we’ve come to the end of the road together.” Orthodox Jews, Roman Catholics and conservative Protestant groups like the Southern Baptist Convention remain adamantly opposed to gay marriage. It is hard to know what impact this is having on attracting and retaining followers. The Public Religion Research Institute found that one-third of millennials who left the faith they grew up with did so because they felt alienated by such narrow, anti-gay views. The Methodists now count 7m American devotees, down from 11m at its 1968 peak. There seems to be a general sense that some change is inevitable. In June the Presbyterian Church voted to change its definition of marriage in order to recognise same-sex unions. American Catholics are pretty evenly divided on same-sex marriage; around half are now in favour of it, says PRRI. Pope Francis’s refreshing take on sexual orientation last year—“Who am I to judge?”—has reportedly helped coax some lapsed Catholics back into pews. This isn’t to say that embracing same-sex marriage will stem the tide of declining membership. Nor is it appropriate to frame the matter as a marketing problem with only one conceivable customer-friendly solution. It is certainly possible for religious institutions to handle gay congregants with compassion, even as they reaffirm the dictates of religious doctrine. At any rate, liberal Protestant and Jewish denominations that recognise same-sex marriage are seeing their numbers fall, too. At its height in the 1960s, Protestant affiliation reached a combined membership of 40m Americans. But this trend has steadily reversed, and mainline Protestants now number around 15m. Between 2012 and 2013 alone, the Presbyterian Church lost 80,000 members. Within the religious marketplace, unaffiliated Americans are actually the fastest growing subset, according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life . More than four in ten American adults have either switched denominations, joined a faith or dropped one altogether. This kind of religious flux is unprecedented. It suggests that Americans are becoming more discerning, spiritually, and are increasingly uncertain about where to land in a culture of rapidly evolving social mores. The biggest shift is generational. “It is difficult,” says PRRI, “to overstate the effect age has on support for same-sex marriage which is evident even among groups that oppose same-sex marriage.” Seven in ten Americans aged 18 to 34 support same-sex unions, as opposed to fewer than four in ten of their elders. Even within evangelical denominations, where support for gay marriage tends to be lowest, twice as many young people as old are supportive (43% versus 19%). The new generation of American adults has radically different social views than those who came before them, and this shift is putting religious groups in an uncomfortable position. Do they adapt to the practices of secular society in order to retain younger congregants? Or will this damage their credibility? The trend appears to be towards greater tolerance. But as more denominations revise their stance on sexual orientation, some are witnessing a backlash. “You can’t allow same-sex marriage until you destroy all religions,” says Phil Burress, president of Citizens for Community Values, a Cincinnati-based conservative group that championed the 2004 constitutional ban on same-sex marriage. Where national religious leaders are wary of making grand pronouncements on the matter, local authorities can be more brave. Regional bodies in the Presbyterian Church, called Presbyteries, are allowed to decide whether to approve same-sex marriages. The United Methodist Church has discussed allowing local congregations to decide for themselves whether to allow same-sex unions and ordain gay clergy members. Among those who wish to be ordained is Frank Schaefer’s son, Tim. Despite the rejection and condemnation he suffered in the church, he still plans to follow his father into the ministry as an advocate for gays. He’s hopeful that the United Methodist Church will change its policies before he finishes his theological training. Hundreds of Methodist ministers have signed a statement declaring that they’re willing to officiate at same-sex ceremonies. Many have also come out as gay and lesbian. At the United Methodist Church’s next general conference in 2016, gay rights advocates within the church intend to push for a removal of the ban on same-sex weddings and the ordination of noncelibate gays and lesbians. If the ban isn’t lifted, the younger Mr Schafer says he’ll join whatever Protestant denomination will accept him.

Mourinho was interested in the ex-Southampton left-back but the 19-year-old chose to move to Manchester United ahead of Chelsea", "content"=>"Jose Mourinho believes the signing of Luke Shaw would have killed his current club, Chelsea, had they have pursued his signature. Mourinho was interested in the ex-Southampton left-back but the 19-year-old chose to move to Manchester United ahead of Chelsea this summer in a £28m deal. In an attempt to silence youngsters within his own squad, Mourinho insists that, had he agreed to Shaw’s wage demands, the dressing room at Stamford Bridge would have been in uproar. Mourinho said: “If we pay to a 19-year-old boy what we were being asked for, to sign Luke Shaw, we are dead. We would have killed our stability with financial fair play, and killed the stability in our dressing room. “Because when you pay that much to a 19-year-old kid – a good player, fantastic player – but when you pay that amount of money, the next day, we would have had players knocking on our door. “They would have been saying ‘How is it possible I play 200 games for this club, won this and that, yet a 19-year-old comes here and gets more money than I get?’ “It would’ve killed immediately our balance, and we couldn’t allow that. “I don’t criticise another club for paying it. They can pay what they want. I don’t have any comment about it. “But for my club we can say it would be very negative for us, especially when we can say Felipe is much less expensive. “Sometimes you have to make decisions.” RedRants Opinion? If a 19yr old’s wage has such a negatively influential effect on your dressing room plus the wage demands of your players, what effect does having countless loanees on vast sums of money themselves have on it? What effect does that have on the ‘balance’ of your club versus that of signing a player who’d slot into 40+ games per season for you? With Moyes at the helm last season it quickly became apparent United were not a force to be reckoned with and thus the mind games appeared to decease early in the campaign. Had Moyes proved to be a danger to others (such as Mourinho) he would have encountered far more verbal battles and mind games than he did. Now, with the obvious strength of mind, direction and will to win being shown by Mr van Gaal already, the competitors are worried and feeling the need to sow seeds of both positivity and negativity within both their own camps and that of United’s. Luke Shaw is the brightest talent in the country right now and Chelsea have failed to secure his services despite his family being loyal Chelsea supporters and the owner having enough pocket money to outbid United for ANY player. Mourinho knows United have purchased the best quality 19yr old in the land and he’s keen to put his own spin on it whilst ultimately attempting to cause unrest within United’s youth ranks by highlighting his (Shaw’s) considerable wage demands. There’s also a guarded message to his own young stars that, unless you’re Luke Shaw, you’re getting paid what we say you’re getting paid and don’t come knocking on my door. Paddy Crerand described Shaw as ‘a man in boys clothes’ the other night and he’s right. These sort of players only come around every now and again and therefore trade for sums and command such wages that pro’s far advanced into theirs careers deserve. Wayne Rooney springs to mind as an obvious example whilst Ross Barkley’s £60,000 per-a-week Everton deal (at a similar age to Shaw) simply serves to reaffirm this. What these players possess is a physicality and mentality way beyond their seemingly tender years. Mourinho’s attempt to unsettle Shaw by highlighting his wage demands will be water off a ducks back. £27m for a teenager who will either go on to make 500+ appearances for United (or leave for a figure WAY beyond that of his initial fee before he reaches that landmark) is undoubtedly good business. Your boy Felipe Luis isn’t a patch on Shaw, Jose, and you know it. If you’re resorting to mind games before the season, I can’t wait to hear what you make of our lack of European commitments during it. You just know that will be the stick he tries to beat van Gaal with like he did with Rodgers last season. Look out Jose, Louis is no Brendan and he’s certainly no David!

It was unclear whether the ceasefire was due to start at 7:00 am Israeli time or GMT. There has been no confirmation from any Israeli sources. Meanwhile, the news agency reported, Kerry confirmed Friday that no ceasefire deal had been reached yet in the conflict in Gaza as he and UN chief Ban Ki-moon urged a seven-day halt in fighting. Expectations had mounted all day for an end to the 18-day conflict, but Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri said neither Israel nor Hamas had shown \"enough willingness to negotiate.\" Kerry, who has been leading international efforts to reach a truce, said at a press conference in Cairo with Shoukri and Ban that both sides \"still have some terminology\" to agree to on a ceasefire, but added they had \"fundamental framework\" on a truce. Kerry said he had not submitted any formal truce proposal. \"They may have rejected some language in the proposal within the framework ... but there was no formal proposal submitted from me,\" he said. Kerry was referring to the Israeli Cabinet’s unanimous vote earlier on Friday to reject a proposal for a ceasefire. An official involved in the negotiations for a ceasefire told The New York Times that Kerry has proposed a two-stage plan that would first impose a weeklong truce starting Sunday. As soon as the truce took effect, Palestinian Authority and Israeli officials would begin negotiations on the principal economic, political and security concerns about Gaza, with other nations attending.

Summer days at the Smiths' pool suddenly were a thing of the past; so were the festive Wednesday night poker games at our house. Any mention of the woman I'd thought of as an aunt—indeed, Selma's very name—was enough to make my mother livid. They didn't reconcile for more than a decade. The grievance that split them apart? An argument over who would pay for a bag of groceries. Buddha would say that my mother's resentment was like a hot coal: She picked it up to throw it at someone else, but she was the one who got burned. Frederic Luskin, PhD, and Carl Thoresen, PhD, who run the Stanford Forgiveness Project at Stanford University, have shown that a grudge is a gift that keeps on giving—misery, that is. It causes anxiety, depression, anger, paranoia, isolation, insomnia, and physical pain. But by forgiving your transgressor, you take back control of your life, and that brings just as outsized a list of benefits. There are physical payoffs, like lower blood pressure; maybe more important, you feel less anger, anxiety, and depression, and more self-esteem. One of the most moving of Luskin's studies was the Stanford-Northern Ireland Hope Project, in which 17 men and women from Northern Ireland, all with family members murdered in the violence there, went to Stanford for forgiveness training. After just a week, these men and women who'd lost parents, children, spouses, and siblings reported a 35% decline in headaches, stomachaches, and other symptoms of stress, and a 20% drop in symptoms of depression. Most people think forgiveness is a good idea, Luskin says—\"until they have something to forgive.\" That may be because so many of us just don't know where to start. Fortunately, the path has been well marked, and one of the best decisions you can make this New Year is to learn how to follow it. Here are five steps to start you on your way. 1. Understand what forgiveness is—and what it isn't. A lot of people don't want to forgive because they think it's wimpy, or that it means they're saying the offender did nothing wrong. It's neither: You can send an offender to jail and forgive him. People also think forgiveness requires reconciling with the person who mistreated them. It can—but it doesn't have to. Forgiveness isn't really about the offender at all. Instead, it's about letting go of the anger that eats at you—accepting that you were wronged but deciding to move on from your hurt. It's an act of profound self-respect and self-care that takes courage and commitment on your part. 2. Grieve for what you've lost. Premature forgiveness has been compared with squirting whipped cream over garbage. The result may look good, but the underlying problem remains and will fester. To truly forgive, you must feel your sorrow, and that can take time. Even after you've decided to let go of your anger, you may feel it flare from time to time. You need to be gentle with yourself, counsels educator Robin Casarjian, founder of the Lionheart Foundation, a national prison rehabilitation program. In time, the memory of what happened will return less often and feel less painful. 3. Don't wait for an apology. Sometimes the person who hurt you isn't even aware that he's done so. In other cases, he's incapable of understanding or caring. The simple words I'm sorry can be healing, but so is deciding that you no longer need to hear them. 4. Try to understand what drove the offender. Generally speaking, bad behavior is the result of emotional immaturity, a state more to be pitied than judged. For example, studies show that many of the criminals in our federal prisons were abused as children. If your ex-friend betrayed a confidence, what insecurity must have driven her? If your father never showed you love and affection, how damaged must he be? Empathy can force out corrosive anger and transform your life—and sometimes the lives of others. Last May, I was a guest on my friend Naomi Judd 's inspirational television program, Naomi's New Morning . The topic of the show was forgiveness, and one of Naomi's guests was a woman named Cheryl Ward, whose husband had been killed and her daughter raped when a gang of teenage boys broke into their home looking for money. Cheryl told a story of radical empathy: Rather than being consumed by her grief and anger, she chose to visit the young men in prison and try to understand what had prompted them to commit such a heinous crime. Developing compassion not only lessened her pain but also led her to become an advocate for inmate rehabilitation. 5. Celebrate who you have become. In a recent study at the University of Miami, psychologist Michael McCullough, PhD, and his colleagues asked approximately 200 people who'd been hurt by someone to write about either the traumatic aspects of the betrayal or things they'd gained as a consequence, like becoming less selfish or discovering that they had unexpected strength. Those who wrote about what they'd learned or how they'd grown described feeling less bitter than the others did and were also more likely to forgive. Life is a school for learning, and some of the lessons are painful ones. We can't avoid being hurt. But we can decide not to let our hurt overshadow the rest of our lives. Choosing to let go and move on doesn't leave you the same as you were before. It brings you greater understanding and maturity and more compassion—toward others, and toward yourself, as well. Smart ways to really move on Take a calming breath.  When an upsetting memory arises, use deep breathing or another stress-management technique to allow yourself to feel your emotions without becoming overwhelmed by them. Change the way you describe yourself.  You were badly hurt--but you're also someone who was brave enough to choose to forgive. Tell it one more time. Acknowledge your hurt to someone you trust, and then stop telling your grievance story once and for all. These stories keep hurt alive and can prevent you from being fully open to the people you need and love.

Russia accused", "content"=>"KYIV, Ukraine — Russia is launching artillery attacks from its soil on Ukrainian troops and preparing to move heavier weaponry across the border, the U.S. and Ukraine charged Friday in what appeared to be an ominous escalation of the crisis. Russia accused Washington of lying and charged Ukraine with firing across the border on a Russian village. It also toughened its economic measures against Ukraine by banning dairy imports. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, said five salvos of heavy rockets were fired across the border near the town of Kolesnikov in the Luhansk region in the country’s east. A border crossing point near Marynovka was fired on twice with mortars, also from the Russian side, while Ukrainian forces shot down three Russian drones, Lysenko said. Col. Steve Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the U.S. has seen powerful rocket systems moving closer to the Ukraine border and that they could be put into the hands of the Russian-backed separatists as soon as Friday. It wasn’t clear what those developments would mean for the international investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. U.S. authorities believe the separatists shot it down with a missile, perhaps in the mistaken belief it was a military plane. A small group of Dutch and Australian investigators combed the sprawling, unsecured field where the plane came down on July 17, taking notes and photos as their governments prepared police detachments they hope can help protect the crash site and bring the last of the 298 victims home. U.S. officials said this week that they had new evidence that Russia intended to deliver heavier and more powerful multiple rocket launchers to the separatists. Warren said Friday that the delivery could happen at any time, adding “it’s that close” to the border. Warren also corroborated Ukrainian reports of artillery fire from Russia. “For the last several days Russian forces using Russian artillery from Russian soil have conducted attacks against Ukrainian military positions in Ukraine,” Warren said. “This is unquestionably an escalation from a military perspective.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry responded to U.S. allegations about cross-border shelling by saying: “Facts and details to confirm these lying contentions do not exist.” Douglas Lute, U.S. ambassador to NATO, accused Russia of waging “civil war by proxy” in Ukraine, and said the Russians have about 15,000 troops massed near the border. He spoke at a security forum in Aspen, Colorado. In another development, CNN said pro-Russian rebels abducted one of its local freelancers on Tuesday outside the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk and was still holding him on Friday. Anton Skiba had worked for the network for only a day when he was seized as he and other members of a CNN crew returned to their hotel from the jetliner crash site. CNN said the abductors first accused Skiba of “terrorism” and of using his Facebook page to post cash rewards for killing separatists. Later they dropped that accusation and said he was being questioned for using identification with different last names. Later they said he had confessed to being a Ukrainian “agent.” The U.S. and human rights groups condemned Skiba’s abduction as an attempt by the rebels to sow fear, CNN reported. “We chose not to report his abduction at the time while making efforts to obtain his release,” CNN spokeswoman Bridget Leininger told The Associated Press late Friday. “That has not happened to date, so we are now publicly asking those who are holding Skiba to release him immediately.” Russia’s Investigative Committee, the country’s top investigative body, said a group of its investigators came under Ukrainian mortar fire Friday in the Russian village of Primiussky. They were investigating the reported shelling two days earlier of the village, which is about 2.5 kilometres from the border. The Investigative Committee said “only the poor preparations of the Ukrainian fighters” and the simultaneous evacuation of the investigators prevented deaths. European Union ambassadors, meanwhile, reached a preliminary deal Friday on stepped-up sanctions against Russia for its involvement in Ukraine, targeting Moscow’s defence and technology sectors and its access to European capital. EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said EU member states must decide whether the measures need to be approved by a summit meeting of the trade bloc’s 28 member countries to go into effect. The ambassadors also ordered asset freezes and travel bans against 15 more Russians and pro-Russian Ukrainians accused of undermining Ukraine. Eighteen businesses or other entities will also be subject to sanctions. Russia increased its economic pressure on Ukraine when its agency in charge of agricultural products announced that it is banning imports of Ukrainian dairy. Russia is the biggest export market for Ukrainian milk and cheese.

Advice can be a terribly dangerous thing, because it can be used as a shortcut for thinking.\" When I asked how he responded to requests for advice, because as a successful entrepreneur he was often solicited for it, he replied that he first shared the structure and the framework he used to look at the problem. Only after discussing that, did he reveal the details about he and his team had arrived at a decision. Each time someone asks for advice, I remember that conversation and the wisdom that entrepreneur shared with me. And I wonder whether what I'm about to say is as helpful as the little piece of paper tucked into a fortune cookie, an out-of-context recommendation, that can be easily misinterpreted. When I reflect on the best advice I've received in my life, it has never been the counsel that provided an immediate point-of-view on an answer. Rather, it was the guidance that started as a single probing question that I couldn't answer immediately, a question that invited me to look upon the puzzle with a new perspective and demanded deeper thought. A little Buddhist Koan. I suppose that's why I gravitate to frameworks and data when I write. Both are starting points for a series of questions about what is similar and unique in different cases; what applies and what doesn't. This process of comparing and contrasting, of testing and defeating assumptions, that's what leads to insight. By accepting advice at face value, we simply copy someone else's answer, which is just as valuable as following the recommendation of a fortune cookie. When someone next asks you for advice, I challenge you to stop, take a moment and think about the right question to ask or the right framework to frame the problem, rather than the best recommendation to make.

Bushwacker just did things bulls shouldn't be able to do. He didn't fit the mold. Everyone agreed he was a remarkable athlete, but some thought his style didn't fit what a bucking bull \"should\" be. They thought that, if he even got to the BFTS, he wouldn't make it to the top.  By year two of his ABBI Classic career, no one was saying that. Folks were coming to watch ABBI events at the start of the season just to see him. Some of the world's top cowboys could be found sitting in the stands at ABBI Classics to check out the animal that could be their foe at an upcoming BFTS.  Just as PBR helps to develop cowboy talent, the ABBI exists to develop bull talent (and to record and preserve their valuable bloodlines). But whereas the bull riders start in the Touring Pro Division and then eventually move up to the BFTS if they have the right stuff, the ABBI Classic bulls gets a taste of the big leagues pretty early on.  Breeding programs have gotten so advanced these days (thanks in part to the ABBI's DNA registry and the $2 million plus they pay animal athletes each season), that Cody Lambert allows ABBI Classic bulls to buck at many BFTS events. That means at certain events (like the upcoming Tulsa and Springfield Built Ford Tough Series events), there are ABBI judges watching the same ride you are, but awarding scores solely to the bulls. Just as one rider will be crowned event champion after the last round, the same is true for the bulls at an ABBI event. Bushwacker started his career as a 2-year-old ABBI Futurity bull, where he won zero events. He did qualify for the ABBI World Finals Futurity, but finished 26th overall.  Reindeer calves can be late bloomers, so to speak, when it comes to \"spin\" and getting their nerves settled in the chutes and feeling comfortable on the arena floor. Bushwacker was like some of his siblings in this respect. He got a great deal of air, but there wasn't too much spin to him as a youngster. But anyone who remembered what an outstanding athlete Reindeer was, was keeping their eye on his son, Bushwacker. With a buck-off rate of nearly 95 percent Reindeer was one of the greats of his time. Bushwacker began to come into his own as a 3-year-old Classic bull, becoming the ABBI Wild Card reserve champion. That got him qualified for the 2009 ABBI World Finals Classic where he finished third. That was the only period he'd ever be ridden back-to-back.  Markus Mariluch would ride be the first man to ride him, for 88 in Las Vegas. Thiago Paguioto would have him in the ABBI Classic (held during night four of the PBR World Finals) and his 8 seconds would be worth 89.75. But many folks still weren't quite sure what to make of Bushwacker.  The big bull apparently didn't care for the taste of defeat. Not a single cowboy would make the whistle on him again for nearly four years. By 2010, his second year of Classic competition, he was seemingly unstoppable. He had established a rhythm and flow that caught the judge's eyes, yet kept the cowboys a half-step behind him.  Bushwacker began to rack up win after win at ABBI events. When it was finally time for the World Finals, he embraced the bright lights of Las Vegas by not only being crowned the ABBI World Champion Classic Bull, but by being in the running for PBR World Champion Bucking Bull at just 4 years old. His ABBI Classic title alone was worth $250,000. The rest, as they say, is history. Bushwacker was PBR World Champion in both 2011 and 2013. He was only ridden one other time, by J.B. Mauney in Tulsa last year, during a trip that earned him a bull score of 46.75. The great bull has been scored as high as 48.25. That would make him 96.5 points, a score virtually unheard of on the bull side of the equation.   Bushwacker is currently on his farewell tour and his storied career will come to a close at the 2014 PBR World Finals.

Locals from Wenzhou, a prefecture in the Zhejiang province, said the river appeared normal at 5 a.m. Beijing time on Thursday but then turned a deep crimson within the hour. Residents also complained of a strange smell that wafted through the air. Inspectors from the Wenzhou Environmental Protection Bureau say haven’t found the cause of the incident, although industrial contamination has been ruled out because there are no chemical plants along the waterway. “Nobody has any idea how it could have ended up being polluted because there are no factories that dump anything in the water here,” one local commented on Weibo, China’s microblogging site. “The really weird thing is that we have always been able to catch fish and you can even drink the water because it’s just normally so good.” PLAGUE RIVER Initial water samples may indicate illegal dumping as the cause for the mysterious transformation. “We suspect that somebody dumped artificial coloring in the water because he thought the typhoon yesterday would cause heavy rain, and nobody would notice [the color],” bureau chief Jianfeng Xiao, told China News . “It turned out there wasn’t heavy rainfall yesterday, so the evidence is left behind.” The investigation is still underway.

Arsene Wenger says Arsenal can now bid on and bring in top talent to provide a base on which to mount a long-overdue sustained assault on the Premier League title -- and indicated that Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina's arrival is imminent. - Carter:  Arsenal's focus now on the present  Wenger has championed the potential of his young squad, with the likes of Aaron Ramsey, Jack Wilshere, Kieran Gibbs, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Laurent Koscielny having experienced the winning feeling in the FA Cup and German trio Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski and Mesut Ozil taking it to another level at the World Cup. While Wenger also maintained the squad did not need major additions this summer, his work in securing the services of 30 million pound Chile forward Alexis Sanchez was seen as something of a personal coup, the Gunners boss having used his time working as a media pundit in Brazil for French television to the club's advantage. Defender Mathieu Debuchy comes in from Newcastle as a Premier League-ready replacement for compatriot Bacary Sagna, who left as a free agent for Manchester City, while the club appear close to bringing in Ospina from Nice as back-up for Wojciech Szczesny. One day before the Gunners face the N.Y. Red Bulls, current club of former hero Thierry Henry, Wenger said his aim is to replicate past successes. \"Yes, I hope so. That's what our target is but still I think we have been very consistent,\" he said at a news conference. \"It was a very different period because we built a new stadium and had to pay it back. We survived at the top level but we want more. We are now on an even ground with the other clubs than we were five or six years ago.\" Even as the new wave of financial incentives have set the club on solid financial footing, Wenger also stressed that the side must remain healthy. \"We have people that won the World Cup and hopefully with that we boost our confidence,\" he said. \"We bought some good players like Alexis Sanchez who will give us different options. And overall last season, we were for a long time top of the league and we lost -- you know we had many injuries and hopefully this year we will be injury-free and start very well.\" While he waits for Ospina's signing to become official, Wenger said the Gunners will focus on Szczensy as goalkeeper. \"You know at the start Szczensy will be the No. 1, then again we'll be down to performances and, if Ospina shows that he is better, he will play,\" he said.", "score"=>167.90616, "summaryTitle"=>"Wenger: Arsenal now on equal footing", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger speaks", "cities"=>"gb", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.espnfc.com/arsenal/story/1960104/arsenal-now-on-even-fiscal-ground-with-other-clubsarsene-wenger-says", "referrer"=>["awimb.com", "bit.ly", "forumprofi.de", "direct", "twitter.com", "t.co", "twitterrific.com", "yoono.com", "statusvia2.com", "facebook.com", "neogaf.com", "dabr.co.uk"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1qEaUvz", "lastseen"=>"20140726004344", "page"=>"http://www.espnfc.com/arsenal/story/1960104/arsenal-now-on-even-fiscal-ground-with-other-clubsarsene-wenger-says", "ogtitle"=>"Wenger: Arsenal now on equal footing"}, {"domain"=>"hcnews.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406329928000", "h3"=>["NewsE", "Archives", "Subscriber Login", "Latest News", "Latest Sports"], "site"=>"hcnews.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004749", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335669604", "title"=>"Man charged with felony in machete incident : Hood County News- A twice-weekly newspaper serving Granbury and Hood County, Texas", "initial"=>"20140725231208", "summaryText"=>"July 25, 2014 Sterling Gene Eakin, 64, of the 4200 block of Sherwood Drive in the Oak Hills subdivision, was arrested on a count of felony family aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after threatening family members with a machete, Sheriff’s Office", "content"=>"July 25, 2014 Sterling Gene Eakin, 64, of the 4200 block of Sherwood Drive in the Oak Hills subdivision, was arrested on a count of felony family aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after threatening family members with a machete, Sheriff’s Office Lieutenant Johnny Rose stated.

Last week, the company launched Checkout, a multi-screen solution for online payments. But omitted from that announcement was an explanation of how Visa plans to tackle the next generation of physical payments, which is made more complicated by the tenuous relationship between merchants, acquirers, financial institutions, government bodies and Visa itself. As detailed in a release today, Visa Digital Solution tackles the problem of future payments into categories: support for new payment methods; and next-generation consumer protection measures. The former ties into what is already on the market, and what is likely to come in the near future: wave-to-pay. Canadians can currently use select NFC-capable devices along with special SIM cards with so-called “secure elements” to make payments at merchants with compatible touchless points of sale , but these are limited to Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phones — devices with Near Field Communication antennas. While only NFC-based solutions for wave-to-pay, or what Visa called payWave, are available at the moment, Apple has been rumoured to be working payment networks like Visa, MasterCard and AMEX to add a secure element to its upcoming iPhone. Coupled with updated points of sale, or additional hardware, these devices will have the capabilities for tap/wave-to-pay as the latest Android or BlackBerry devices. The next type of payment is QR-code based, called scan-to-pay. Visa recently published a specification for securely displaying customer payment information as a QR code, and should allow Starbucks-like scanning for credit or debit payments. Of course, the information displayed would not directly translate to a user’s payment credentials, and that’s where the next-generation consumer protection measures come in. Likely the most important change to how payments will be processed in the future is how they will be stored. Tokenization, the ability to replace a customer’s 16-digit credit card number with an equivalent set of random numbers that  represent the real thing, allows third-party vendors to safely handle transaction information without the same security concerns. Because tokens represent, and replace, the actual payment information credentials, they can be safely stored on a smartphone or wearable, or on a company’s cloud. If a device is stolen, or a server breached, not only is there limited concern that the token can be decrypted, but in such an event it can be remotely disabled and a new one issued. This avoids a small breach necessitating a physical card replacement. Indeed, tokenization is so important that Visa is working with all of its merchants, acquirers (point-of-sale providers) and issuers to make them quickly an industry standard. While this ties into the likely NFC-deficient iPhone 6 in many ways, tokenization also points to another technology that Visa has been working on over the past year: Host Card Emulation A secure element is great because it ensures that payment credentials are securely stored in something physical, but it also necessitates the purchase of something physical, too — in this case, a SIM card. Host Card Emulation, or HCE, recreates a smart card, in this case a Visa card, in software. While HCE is only available on Android 4.4 devices and above, it will, along with the implementation of tokenization, allow for a greater number of devices — and wearables — to facilitate payments. According to The Information , Apple has been speaking with Visa and other payment providers on bringing a wallet feature to the iPhone 6. According to Amir Efrati, “Apple has told some partners its system would involve a so-called secured element in the phones—a piece of hardware where sensitive information such as a phone owner’s financial credentials can be stored. The company also aims to run the system without giving up any control to wireless carriers.” Whether this would come in the form of a dedicated app, or an expansion of Passbook, remains to be seen, but Apple products have heretofore been left out of the NFC-based mobile payment game, something of which Tim Cook and co. are keenly aware. As for Visa Digital Solutions, the effort will roll out early next year in the US, followed by a Canadian launch shortly thereafter. Expect Visa Checkout to be far more ubiquitous long before then.

The England striker is one of the frontrunners for the job along with Robin van Persie. Darren Fletcher is also under consideration after he was named captain for Louis van Gaal's first game in charge against LA Galaxy this week. Rooney will also have an eye on the England captaincy after Steven Gerrard announced his retirement from international football. And the 28-year-old has made clear his desire to wear the armband for his club, too. As he prepared for United's game with Roma in Denver on Saturday, Rooney said: “Of course I would like the captaincy but it’s the manager's decision who he chooses. “I think he wants to work with the players and then choose a captain from there. “I don’t think he was ever going to just walk in and choose a player from the off.  I’m sure he will look at the players now and make his decision in a couple of weeks.” And if he does get the nod from Van Gaal, Rooney insists he could end next season by lifting the Premier League trophy. He added: “We can win the title. Last season was a bad one, we know that, but we are confident we can put it right. We have to believe we can win the title.” If Rooney has been looking to impress Van Gaal on the tour of the United States, he couldn't have done much more than score twice in 45 minutes against the LA Galaxy. He revealed he paid close attention to Holland's games during the World Cup to get an insight into his new manager – and is now enjoying getting a closer look at how the Dutchman works. “In Brazil I watched the way Holland were playing and I carried on doing that when I came home,” he said. “However you can watch as much as you want but it’s when you hear him getting his point across in training that you start to learn. “Louis van Gaal has been great. I’ve only had a few days but he’s a strong guy who has been good in training and it’s been enjoyable. “He is bringing in a new style of play and wants us all to adapt to that and that’s been enjoyable. “He’s very honest in training. If you are not doing well in training he will tell you but if you do well he will praise you. If you aren’t doing things right in training you need to know so that you can put them right.” MORE Denis Law backs Louis van Gaal to return Reds to Europe's top table LA Galaxy match shows differences between US and UK football fans United tour diary: Denver warm to Reds View gallery \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" \" View gallery   There was talk Rooney could find himself moved out wide to accommodate Robin van Persie under the new manager. But Van Gaal made a point of saying in his press conference after the 7-0 victory over LA Galaxy that his desire to play with two strikers was behind his decision to play 3-5-2. And that bodes well for Rooney, who is now likely to partner Van Persie with Juan Mata playing a supporting role in the No.10's position if Van Gaal persists with his system next season. “The system is good for me,” said Rooney. “It’s great to hear him say he wants to play two strikers as we have a few. “It’s a good formation and it’s good to work on it in training for a few days. It was always going to be interesting to see how it worked in a game and it worked well, which is good. “It was disappointing the way the World Cup went but I said at the time it was time for me to look forward and concentrate on Manchester United. “That is what I am doing. I am just trying to get fit and get ready for the season. “It's great to be here. I have had a good break and I’m happy to be here. “We have a few weeks before the season starts and all this is just preparing for the first game against Swansea.” Catch us on the go with our app and e-edition for your phone and tablet  ", "score"=>167.6911, "summaryTitle"=>"Rooney after captaincy - and the title", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"\nThe United forward accepts the captaincy is down to the manager but believes he is up to the task and is enjoying the new Reds regime.\n", "cities"=>"gb", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-pre-season-tour-wayne-7510181", "referrer"=>["twitter.com", "t.co", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1pUyxe5", "lastseen"=>"20140726004440", "page"=>"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-pre-season-tour-wayne-7510181", "ogtitle"=>"Rooney after captaincy - and the title"}, {"domain"=>"wellandgood.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406269453000", "h3"=>["Leave a Comment (* required)", "MORE"], "site"=>"wellandgood.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004410", "keywords"=>"fitness studio investment, private equity and boutique fitness, yogaworks,anywhere edition,wall street,yogaworks,wellness wire", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335450536", "title"=>"Fitness and wellness are the next big thing—in investment | Well+Good NYC", "initial"=>"20140725062413", "summaryText"=>"Sure, you’re reminded that boutique fitness studios are booming each time you get placed on the waitlist for spin class.

But now, investment firms are noticing in a big way, too. ( Wall Street’s wellness maven was obviously on to something.) According to the Wall Street Journal , YogaWorks sold to a Boston-based private equity firm last week for $45 million, and Barry’s Bootcamp could fetch $100 million in a sale, which the Journal said it was considering (although our insider sources tell us that its reported interest in selling was purely speculative). But these numbers are just the beginning, the money-focused pub reports : “Piper Jaffray, which advises on deals in the fitness sector, says boutique chains have been adding new studios at a clip of 450% a year since 2010. That makes them the fastest-growing part of the $22-billion-a-year U.S. health-club industry, according to the investment bank.” We’ve been seeing it all along, of course, from Equinox acquiring SoulCycle in 2011 to Flywheel’s recent influx of capital to CorePower’s big investment last year. And it’s not just fitness. Wellness brands in other sectors, like juice, are being infused with cash and sold at crazy rates, too, like Organic Avenue’s recent acquisition by private equity firm Weld North and BluePrint’s sale to Hain Celestial. While the big money being thrown at fitness and wellness businesses could mean more studios and healthy options for those who love going to them, we don’t think this means the prices for these experience are going to drop anytime soon.

Late last week, after several months of speculation, the youngest of the Ford clan to dabble in municipal politics filed the necessary papers to run in Ward 2, the area currently represented by his uncle, Doug. What do we know about Michael Ford? Honestly, very little. 20-year-old Michael Ford is the child of Ennio Stirpe and Kathy Ford, the older sister of mayor Rob and councillor Doug. Ford graduated Richview CI in 2010 and is currently splitting his time between Humber College and Deco Labels and Tags , the Ford family business, where he's listed as an account executive. Michael is also a counsellor at Camp Kandalore in the Algonquin Highlands and, according to Doug Ford, the holder of a pilot's license for light aircraft. On Facebook, a photo of Michael posing beside a floatplane was swapped for a more formal portrait shot once his candidacy was announced. \"He went out and got his pilot's license by the time he was 18,\" Doug told CP24 . \"He got the additional training to land on a lake. Speaking of that, I wouldn't even hop on the back of a bicycle with 99 percent of the councillors, not to mention in a plane. So he's a bright individual, he understands politics, and he has a pedigree of learning politics for 20 years of his life.\" Michael has a 26-year-old step-sister, whose father, Michael Kiklas, Ennio Stirpe killed with a sawed-off shotgun in 1998. Michael's biological father served two thirds of a 13-year manslaughter sentence as a result of the shooting and, according to a 2012 Toronto Life feature , was convicted in Dec. 2011 of stabbing a girlfriend \"so savagely she was blinded in one eye.\" From what can be gleaned from his online presence (Michael didn't return our voicemail,) Ford shares his family's conservative political views. In answering a question about Dalton McGuinty's performance as Ontario premier on social media, he said \"I hope he leaves Ontario and never comes back.\" Michael Ford hasn't offered a political platform or taken part in any interviews. Doug Ford said his nephew wouldn't be speaking to reporters because the media was too biased. As a Ward 2 candidate, he'll be running against 11 others (at time of publication,) including Andray Domise , a writer, financial planner, community organizer, and vocal critic of the incumbent Doug Ford. Domise recently spoke out against a handgun ban proposed by Olivia Chow, calling it \"dog-whistle\" politics. He has also called out Rob Ford for his racist remarks .

Hieu Minh Ngo, now 25, was caught and admitted to posing as a private investigator in Singapore to get exclusive access to data via Court Ventures, an Experian subsidiary. Ngo then said he sold access to fellow criminals. Federal investigators say that let criminals reach databases with 200 million Americans' personal data, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, birthdays, work history, driver's license numbers, email addresses and banking information. Criminals tapped that database 3.1 million times, investigators said. Surprised you haven't heard this? It's because Experian is staying quiet about it. It's been more than a year since Experian was notified of the leak. Yet the company still won't say how many Americans were affected. CNNMoney asked Experian to detail the scope of the breach. The company refused. \"As we've said consistently, it is an unfortunate and isolated issue,\" Experian spokesman Gerry Tschopp said. Target and Experian insist that the credit monitoring service is unrelated to the incident involving Experian's data-selling business. But Barry Kouns, a security professional who maintains a database of major data breaches, said Target victims remain at risk -- just in a different way. According to his company's Cyber Risk Analytics database, Experian's databases have been involved in 97 breaches of personal information. \"Based on our research, it appears that data brokers place a high value on collecting and using our information but not so much on protecting it,\" Kouns said.", "score"=>167.60384, "summaryTitle"=>"Target sent victims to Experian, which has sold your data to criminals", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Companies can't keep your data safe.

Main St.  According to Police Chief Kevin Halloran, the near collision occurred just after noon today as Officer Kenney was traveling eastbound on East Main Street with his lights and siren activated. Kenney, a traffic division motorcycle and vehicle officer, took quick and evasive action when he saw the car coming toward him, the chief said in an interview. To avoid a direct hit, he controlled both his skid and his slide across the pavement in order to avoid being hit head-on. Initially police thought there was no contact between the vehicles. It turned out that the woman’s car was slightly damaged on one side, officers said. Kenney suffered some bruises but apparently was in good enough condition to sit on the lawn while waiting for emergency medical services to arrive. “We are extremely fortunate he wasn’t seriously injured,” the chief said.  “He is OK. He’s a bit banged up but he is alert and conscious,” the chief added. “He has some bruises.” He was taken to Yale-New Haven Hospital by Branford fire department paramedics for further evaluation.  The car was driven by a woman police later identified as Cheryl Dombrowski of 15 Applewood Rd. She was seeking to make a left turn from the restaurant’s driveway onto East Main Street. The restaurant is near a small shopping mall and near the Mews apartments. She pulled over. A crowd gathered. Dombrowski was later charged with traffic infractions, including one for disobeying the signal of an officer.   Police descended on the scene, taking measurements of the road and the vehicles as they put together their reconstruction of the accident. Traffic was halted in both directions as they measured distances from one side of the road to the other.   ###       Post a Comment You must and be logged in to comment If you already have an account , please log in using the link in the upper left corner of the page | If not, please .

At your office, perhaps the marketers and developers can’t agree on a launch date. Or as a freelancer, perhaps an irate client is strong-arming you into another round of design revisions. But   before we try to deal with a conflict, Mark Gerzon, the author of Leading Through Conflict: How Successful Leaders Transform Differences Into Opportunities , asks us to stop and consider the following question: Is the conflict hot or cold? Hot conflict is when one or more parties are highly emotional and doing one or more of the following: speaking loudly or shouting; being physically aggressive, wild or threatening; using language that is incendiary; appearing out of control and potentially explosive. Cold conflict is when one or more parties seem to be suppressing emotions, or actually appear “unemotional,” and are doing one or more of the following: muttering under their breath or pursing their lips; being physically withdrawn or controlled; turning away or otherwise deflecting contact; remaining silent or speaking in a tone that is passively aggressive; appearing shut down or somehow frozen. Gauging the temperature of the conflict allows us to deal with the particular   situation’s needs. Gerzon suggests that cold conflicts need to be warmed up and that hot conflicts need to be cooled down: If the conflict is hot: You don’t want to bring participants in a hot conflict together in the same room without settings ground rules that are strong enough to contain the potentially explosive energy. For example, if you are dealing with a conflict between two board members who have already attacked each other verbally, you would set clear ground rules — and obtain agreement to them — at the outset of your board meeting before anyone has a chance to speak. If the conflict is cold: You can usually go ahead and bring the participants or stakeholders in the conflict together, engaging them in constructive communication. That dialogue, if properly facilitated, should “warm up” the conflict enough so that it can begin to thaw out and start the process of transformation. But you will still need to be vigilant and prepared. Conflict is often cold precisely because so much feeling is being repressed. So you need to skillfully know how to warm it up without the temperature unexpectedly skyrocketing. As our teams grow, so do the opportunities for conflict. “Conflict resolution, like cooking, works best at the optimal temperatures,” Gerzon says. “You want to bring conflict into a temperature zone where it can become useful and productive.” [ via ] by Hamza Khan on Jul 23, 2014 - 3:45pm", "score"=>167.38803, "summaryTitle"=>"Headphones Are Shortening Your Career", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"The more you disconnect from the place your ideas come from, the less likely you are to send them back into it.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://99u.com/workbook/29519/headphones-are-shortening-your-career", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "twitterrific.com", "yoono.com", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1t4zLsn", "lastseen"=>"20140725234213", "page"=>"http://99u.com/workbook/29519/headphones-are-shortening-your-career", "ogtitle"=>"Headphones Are Shortening Your Career"}, {"domain"=>"dailyedge.ie", "initial_epoch"=>"1406329281000", "h2"=>"Just what we need for summer.", "h3"=>["About the author:", "Contribute to this story:", "Israel rejects John Kerry ceasefire proposal", "The Briefcase: a US President, the Budget and definitely not a housing bubble", "‘I was taken by the fact that he’s such an outsider’ – Adrian McCarthy on his upcoming Paul Kimmage film"], "site"=>"www.dailyedge.ie", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004102", "keywords"=>"slide to the left, Summer, water slide, West Cork", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335262562", "title"=>"This 220ft water slide in West Cork looks like fantastic fun", "initial"=>"20140725230121", "summaryText"=>"ON THESE SWELTERING days, nothing sounds more appealing than going down a water slide.

Unaware that they were transmitting sexist nonsense to cyberspace, the IBM executives openly discussed \"why they don't hire women.\" If you take Kirkham's account at its word, it actually gets way worse. She also noted this wasn't exclusively a sausage-fest, with a woman echoing the remarks. In a discussion with the Daily Dot ,  Kirkham noted the executives also said women need more off time to \"decompress from work related stress\" and complained by name about a number of current female IBM employees they expected to take time off for pregnancies in future years. (Wow.) Kirkham was so taken aback she initially thought the group was drunk. Kirkham told  Think Progress she thinks the conversation highlighted a systemic problem. \"It's rampant,\" she said . \"Workplace issues around equality [in technology companies such as the] gaming industry are everywhere.\" Some background:  Kirkham's Twitter tirade at the very least highlights a pervasive trend in the tech industry. According to a study in 2008 , an astonishing 52% of women (most between 35 and 44) drop out of private-sector science and technology jobs around the world and never return. Center for Work-Life Policy Director Laura Sherbin said that \" The top two reasons why women leave are the hostile macho cultures — the hard hat culture of engineering, the geek culture of technology or the lab culture of science … and extreme work pressures.\" Part of the problem is thanks to overt sexist attitudes like those Kirkham encountered. One study found that participants were twice as likely to hire a man over an equally-qualified woman for a mathematics-related job. Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers show the share of women programmers declined from 24% in 2000 to 21% in 2010, which  Businessweek partially attributed to a \"frat boy mentality\" among tech startups dominated by young men. Tech people call them \" brogrammers .\" But sexism is far more widespread than the bros , which is probably a big reason that just 17% of Google's tech employees are women. Another key barrier is that women are still expected to do most of the work in raising a family, which gives them less time to devote to an intensive STEM job. This has also led some exasperated women to have lower career expectations than men, suppressing their salaries and job potential. This situation is slowly changing , but as Kirkham's hopefully honest Tweets illustrate, there's still a ton of work to do.", "score"=>167.24615, "summaryTitle"=>"A Woman Live Tweeted IBM Executives Discussing Why They Don't Hire Women", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"And it&#039;s absolutely awful.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://mic.com/articles/94978/a-woman-live-tweeted-ibm-executives-discussing-why-they-don-t-hire-women", "referrer"=>["linkbucks.com", "direct", "t.co", "twitterrific.com", "tweetlist.com", "facebook.com", "comcast.net"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1rCTZr1", "lastseen"=>"20140726004559", "page"=>"http://mic.com/articles/94978/a-woman-live-tweeted-ibm-executives-discussing-why-they-don-t-hire-women", "ogtitle"=>"A Woman Live Tweeted IBM Executives Discussing Why They Don&#039;t Hire Women"}, {"domain"=>"wbbjtv.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406326476000", "site"=>"www.wbbjtv.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004652", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335612402", "title"=>"Criminal record of former Madison County Sheriff David Woolfork expunged | WBBJTV West Tennessee's News Channel | Local News", "initial"=>"20140725221436", "summaryText"=>"DOWNTOWN JACKSON -- Former Madison Sheriff David Woolfork no longer has a criminal record, after a judge has his record expunged.

Dear John, We are here again, then. On with the sensible", "content"=>"Entertainment 07.24.14 As another legal battle unfolds around his alleged homosexuality, what the actor can do for the best—and why gay Hollywood needs to shake itself from its hypocritical slumber. Dear John, We are here again, then. On with the sensible suit and fixed, stony glares. Heading to court. Big, fancy lawyers. Trying to keep a lid on yet more rumors about your sexuality . Claims you are gay. Dumb phrases, aren’t they? Aren’t you exhausted with this? We’re exhausted for you. Now a judge has told your former pilot, Douglas Gotterba , that he can make a case that he is not bound by a past termination of employment agreement. He wants to talk, apparently, about a relationship he says was more than professional . He has spoken to the National Enquirer and is planning a book. Gotterba says his termination of employment did not include a confidentiality clause, which your lawyer, Marty Singer, later cited. Singer, a formidable Hollywood legal pugilist, said ultimately that “we [he and Travolta] will prevail in this action.” That choice of wording fascinated me. Does “prevail” here mean succeeding in somehow ensuring Gotterba’s silence? Is that really a victory to cherish? What are you fighting for here? What are you worried about him revealing that could be more exposing than his 2012 interview with the Enquirer , dismissed by your reps at the time as “ridiculous”? Your supposed affair sounds very romantic, at least as reported by the Enquirer : bottles of Merlot, massage, and then your final encounter in 1992, when in a perfect collision of narratives you reportedly had just left the Church of Scientology’s Celebrity Center in Hollywood with your wife, and you suggested Gotterba join you for a walk on the beach. “We were making small talk,” Gotterba is alleged to have said, according to the article, “when suddenly, I blurted out, ‘So, John, tell me. Now that you’re married, do you still prefer men—or women?’ He looked me straight in the eye and said, ‘Well, Doug, I still prefer men!’ I said, ‘Okay.’ And that’s the last time we saw each other.” All lies, your side has said. I suppose your lawyer’s contention that you will “prevail” must give you cause to be optimistic. But to what end? How many stories have surfaced in recent years alluding to you supposedly having gay sex? Are they all utterly fanciful? In 1991 you married Kelly Preston, yet still stories persisted that you hit on men in hotel and country club shower rooms. You have been photographed kissing a man. Are all these setups, coincidences, misunderstandings, a shabby mass tabloid conspiracy, people on the make? Are the stories false, but you yourself gay? In a 2012 lawsuit , filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, an unnamed male masseur accused you of sexual assault, sexual battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, saying you came on to him several times during a massage session at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Then there was another lawsuit. So far, you and your lawyers have successfully warded off all of the lawsuits . In 2010 Carrie Fisher said of you to The Advocate : “I mean, my feeling about John has always been that we know and we don’t care. Look, I’m sorry that he’s uncomfortable with it, and that’s all I can say. It only draws more attention to it when you make that kind of legal fuss. Just leave it be.” “Just leave it be.” The best thing to do, for Fisher, is for you to let the rumors rain down around you, and you maintain a stoic silence with a whole bunch of \"we\" people in Hollywood knowing the truth, and that will be enough of an insulation of some kind. “You know, I would hope that he would be able to be himself. It’s not even like I’m outing him, because it’s so obvious. That’s like outing Liberace.” Fisher is suggesting you stop protesting these mentions of your sexuality, and that everyone knows and couldn’t care anyway. “I’m sorry he’s uncomfortable with it,” she says, a phrase that levels you with all your Hollywood millions—if you are gay—with the teacher from Topeka, the young kid from Boston, the lesbian grandmother from Abilene. Fear. Maybe shame. Discomfort. Worry. Looking over your shoulder. Checking your behavior. Trying to pass. The whole, inhibiting closet cocktail. Then there’s your association with Scientology, which you’re a longtime believer in and which has had to deny having an anti-gay track record—strange, as its churches seem as camp and outlandish as a Bavarian count’s castle. Of all the things if you are gay, I hope you didn’t go to the church with a hope of being de-gayed and that your sexuality isn’t negatively bound up somehow in your continued association with it. I feel for you, of course. It's been a strange few years for you in the public mind: your great film roles like Saturday Night Fever , Grease , and Pulp Fiction (and I loved you in Primary Colors ) seem squarely in the past. Your hair-weaves or wigs or whatever's going on up there have become alarming. You are now best known for appearing in public in your pilot’s uniform, as when Oprah promised to fly her audience to Australia. And, as Tuesday’s news about the latest legal action showed, the public probably best knows you for the rumors surrounding your sexuality, which have become a constant, like a whirring fan. If they are untrue, I can understand your irritation, yet you have never roundly denied them. Indeed, the rumors have become their own, well-worn joke. You’ve been outed, and then joked about being outed. Last year, the comedian Margaret Cho denied she’d outed you in her stage act, noting: “You know, I would hope that he would be able to be himself. It’s not even like I’m outing him, because it’s so obvious. That’s like outing Liberace. All I’m doing is taking public speculation and joining it with what I know to be true.” She, like me, feels oddly sorry for you. “Ultimately, I think he’s a good guy,” Cho said, “and I think he is suffering, and it’s sad for somebody like that, who has made such a big contribution to film and to pop culture, who’s made to live under this guise of heterosexuality. I’m actually on his side.” John, I get it. Some will impatiently say, “But it’s 2014,” when wondering why people still stay in the closet, and point to all the massive strides in equality, the traversed beachheads of pop culture of gay kisses in prime time, the general welcoming change in the cultural and political climate, but coming out remains the same vexed, and—even if it’s positive—intensely individual thing it has always been. While we wave our rainbow flags and hail the onward march of marriage equality, we forget the more mundane individual terrors or challenges of coming to terms with who we are and of telling other people about that. And then we must factor in if that “you” is a Hollywood star of a certain generation, with all the fear of shattered careers and fan desertion, and industry shutters clapping down should the dreaded words be said, the truth be known. I don’t know if you are gay, John, or maybe something else, its definition known only to you. But one thing that is indubitably true is that, no matter the progress in society and law, Hollywood’s top tier remains a warped paradise of closetry. No major Hollywood movie star of your stature is out, male or female. The very fact of that tells us either that there are no lesbian or gay movie stars—unlikely—or that the industry is hostile to the idea; the same industry that prides itself on its liberalism, its alignment to liberal causes, and whose denizens can regularly be relied upon to talk about the importance of freedom, artistic or otherwise. The fear that keeps the closet so active in Hollywood, one supposes, is that no one would buy a leading man who is gay, that the macho, gun-wielding swaggerer he has to play on screen, the charming skirt-chaser, would be heinously compromised by the offscreen knowledge that he sleeps with, and loves, men. But as long as Hollywood doesn’t trust society to suspend disbelief in its actors’ ability to act, this ugly, progress-inhibiting standoff will persist. Sportsmen like Michael Sam faced similar granite walls of incomprehension and outright prejudice after they came out, but they still did it. And they’re still in the game. And people’s respect for them grows, not diminishes. The right people are on their side, the bigots are the dinosaurs. The other argument—one gay people regularly hear, from the very rich to those of us without the level of financial security and luxury you possess—is that one’s private’s life is no one’s business but one’s own. This I would buy into more heartily if movie stars like you didn’t exhibit, and talk about, their wives and families so happily. Stars seem only too happy to compromise their privacy when it suits their own publicity ends, then complain when it is invaded by others; that is, when things are said about them that they don’t like or don’t control. If you are gay, John, what an absurd position you keep painting yourself in. But also, Hollywood, what’s up with you, elevating a culture of lies, secrets, and repression around lesbian and gay sexuality—this when so many gay people work in Hollywood? Shame on all the gay men and women colluding in that. There are so many of you there, and so little of substance in terms of gay narratives and representation (with honorable exceptions including Dustin Lance Black and Ryan Murphy) emerging from the Hollywood factory. There is something even more shaming that there are so many of you—agents, PRs—maintaining an all-pervasive, and culturally influential, closet for the leading talent you service. After a successful day marketing them as straight, do you still have Pride parties? Go out drinking in the bars? Rail at the bigots in Washington on TV seeking to curtail equality? Hold your outrage. Look in the mirror. Some have questioned whether it would make a difference if a Hollywood star came out; what, eventually, it shows and does. But even as symbolism it resonates, just as the symbolism of stars like you, John, fighting legal cases, trying to silence people, trying to shut talk down, sends a message, ultimately, of shame around one’s sexuality. Do you realize, John, that the world would still turn if you were gay, that the best people would welcome you, that yes, it is difficult whether you are rich or poor, but families can recast themselves, and the worst idiots spewing their hatred or disapproval would be easily jettisoned? But also, just think: no more stupid court cases. No more men claiming to have had sex with you in saunas, no more handsome conquests from the past—grayer now, but they still have it—coming forward to sue you, or expose you. Because once you’re out, that vital central fact of you is un-exposable. You’ve done it. You’ve neutralized every poison arrow just by being honest. You’d also be doing so much good. The ripples of change coming from coming out, whether Hollywood celebrity or rural teen, are always surprising, and proof that the personal is political in the best, most life-enhancing way. But like I say, I don’t know who or what you are. So I suppose, again—grind grind—we shall see you in court. Or if not there, maybe the spa. Just two regular guys getting some steam.

So it's little surprise that when the station talks about the most recent Gaza dust-up, they tend to leave out facts that support Israel's cause. Unfortunately, when your guest is Ron Dermer, that tends to blow up in your face.  Dermer is the Israeli ambassador to the United States, and he didn't feel like letting CNN's bias slide during a recent appearance.  Instead of doing the usual news-guest dance, he ripped into the network's unwillingness to report the facts. Dermer appeared with host Erin Burnett, who was grilling the Ambassador on the destruction of a UN School.  “I do know who's responsible for it, and that's Hamas - because they're using schools as weapons depots. And I think it would be a disservice to your viewers for a reporter from Gaza not to mention that in the last week we had two different UNRWA schools where we had actually rockets found -in the schools - and handed over to Hamas.\" Burnett interrupted \"These are two different UN schools you're saying?\" Dermer then launched into a blistering assault on CNN's lazy reporting:  \"That's correct. That's publicly available information.  And it's kind of an important fact for your reporter to mention. In addition to that he may have wanted to mention a statement that was made by - not by the Israeli Ambassador, not by the spokesman of the IDF, but by the UN Secretary General Yesterday. Not last year,  yesterday.     He said that 'the secretary general is alarmed to hear that rockets were placed at an UNRWA school in Gaza, and that subsequently these have gone missing. He expresses his outrage and regret at the placing of weapons in a UN administered school. By doing so...' Now listen, Erin, to exactly what he said -  'those responsible are turning schools into potential military targets and endangering the lives of innocent children...' This is yesterday.  Do you not think that it’s relevant to report on CNN that the Secretary General of the United Nations yesterday warned against the use of UN schools and shelter for rocket missile depots of Hamas?” The host admitted that, just maybe, that was worth reporting. Dermer fired back “Well, Erin, I've been listening to two hours of reports on CNN.  I've seen split screens of horrible pictures - horrible pictures that any decent human being would be horrified by. I have not heard a single person say what I’ve just said to you now.” Burnett tries to continue with the standard CNN talking points, but things don't go well for her.  Dermer holds the line and continues to torch CNN's obviously one-sided reports.  ...and good for him.  It's about time people stopped buying into the mountain of false premises offered by left-leaning media outlets. As I said above, this bias is nothing new.  However it's nice to see someone who refuses to tolerate it. We should probably be grateful CNN isn't running a nightly installment of \"why America and its allies are always wrong\" - and, before you ask, no. That wasn't the name of Piers Morgan's talk show.   Be sure to \"like\" Robert Laurie  over on Facebook  and follow him  on Twitter.  You'll be glad you did.  ", "score"=>167.13885, "summaryTitle"=>"Politics: Israel's U.S. Ambassador appears on CNN - destroys CNN's biased reporting", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"This is what ", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.caintv.com/isareals-u.s.ambassador-appear", "referrer"=>["iconfactory.com", "direct", "googleusercontent.com", "twitter.com", "t.co", "twitterrific.com", "facebook.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1mNiPhH", "lastseen"=>"20140726003910", "page"=>"http://www.caintv.com/isareals-u.s.ambassador-appear", "ogtitle"=>"Israel's U.S. Ambassador appears on CNN - destroys CNN's biased reporting"}, {"domain"=>"jrn.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406331631000", "h2"=>"Latest Now Trending", "h3"=>["Get news or weather in your inbox", "Comments", "Lansing, MI", "Follow Now Trending", "Email us: tips@nowtrending.com", "Headlines", "NowTrending.com"], "site"=>"www.jrn.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004624", "keywords"=>"meth, methadone, baby formula, mother, arrested, Rhode Island, now trending", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335584020", "title"=>"Mother arrested for mixing meth with her baby’s formula - FOX 47 News", "initial"=>"20140725234031", "summaryText"=>"A 27-year-old mother in Johnston, Rhode Island, has been arrested and faces child abuse charges after she allegedly mixed methadone with her six-month-old baby’s formula and fed it to the child.

Gonzalez is accused of beating El Paso Police Officer Jonathan Molina to death nearly two years ago while Molina was off duty. Gonzalez testified he did not see his friend Tony Gomez scratch Molina's car, and said Molina shouted a gay slur at their group of three friends when he first approached them. After that, Gonzalez said he Gomez and their friend, Alan Medrano, started walking away and Molina followed them down Trowbridge in his car. Gonzalez testified that Molina approached Gomez. When the argument started to get heated, Gonzalez said he pushed Gomez out of the way. When the argument between Molina and Gonzalez escalated, Gonzalez said Molina pushed him and threatened to hurt his friends. Gonzalez said he puched Molina in the face and took him down to the ground after that, because he said he was \"afraid for his life.\" \"[Molina] didn't carry himself like an officer. He was acting like a street jerk. That's one of the reasons I asked him to show me a badge,\" Gonzalez said. Gonzalez and Medrano both testified Molina refused to show them police identification. However, the prosecution said neither one of them told police this after the incident happened. The prosecution also brought up Facebook messages Gonzalez sent to his girlfriend at the time, saying he took ecstasy pills at school the day of the incident. Gonzalez testified the effects wore off by that afternoon. Gonzalez testified the group left the scene because he said he thought Molina was going to get up and fight back. The prosecution also showed Facebook messages Gonzalez sent the day of the attack, saying that he saw Molina \"twitching and bleeding\" on the ground before the group left the scene. Assistant District Attorney Denise Butterworth said Gonzalez should be charged with capital murder. Gonzalez testified that Molina did mention he was a police officer during their argument. \"This is a severe beating that gives evidence to the jury there is intent,\" Butterworth said.

On Friday, she went where few ESPN employees are willing to go and publicly criticized First Take for their facepalm-inducing debate/segment/whatever on Ray Rice ( which is really bringing out the worst in everybody it seems ).  Here’s the relevant transcript via Deadspin , including the part where Stephen A. Smith makes it very clear that women need to stop provoking domestic abuse: But domestic violence or whatever the case may be, with men putting their hands on women, is obviously a very real, real issue in our society. And I think that just talking about what guys shouldn’t do, we got to also make sure that you can do your part to do whatever you can do to make, to try to make sure it doesn’t happen. We know they’re wrong. We know they’re criminals. We know they probably deserve to be in jail. In Ray Rice’s case, he probably deserves more than a 2-game suspension which we both acknowledged. But at the same time, we also have to make sure that we learn as much as we can about elements of provocation. Not that there’s real provocation, but the elements of provocation, you got to make sure that you address them, because we’ve got to do is do what we can to try to prevent the situation from happening in any way. And I don’t think that’s broached enough, is all I’m saying. No point of blame. And Beadle’s reaction, which speaks for a good chunk of rational-minded individuals whose eyebrows were also raised by Smith’s comments: https://twitter.com/ MichelleDBeadle/status/ 492710654462025731 First Take is one of ESPN’s sacred shows and Bill Simmons was infamously suspended from Twitter for also taking the worst television program in sports to task.  ESPN would be incredibly tone deaf (maybe as much as the NFL in their original punishment of Rice) to suspend Beadle here likewise for breaking whatever is left of their very selective social media policy .  Kudos to Beadle for speaking up against nonsense coming from in-house when it is deserved.

These platforms can be launch pads for complex hardware to be brought to the world, or allow artists, makers, and people with far-reaching ideas to get exposure. But before you can leverage them as part of your arsenal of funding avenues you need to know how. The Next 36 allows entrepreneurs to learn about innovation from some of the best professors at leading global universities. Earlier in June, Christian Catalini , assistant professor of MIT’s Sloan School of Management, travelled to Toronto to deliver a lecture on crowdfunding. I had the opportunity to sit in. Here are some of my key takeaways: Presales win The projects we consistently hear about — Oculus Rift , Pebble , and more recently the Vanhawks Valour smart bike — all have something in common: you are pre-ordering a product. More than 86% of the funding raised from the Oculus Rift campaign came from people who ordered the product. Allowing pre-orders has obvious benefits, but leaves the impression that donations are not driving the success of rewards-based crowdfunding. But crowdfunding allows founders to create a community of early-adopters and presales are a metric to gauge interest in your product before it hits the market, as well as providing the all-important word-of-mouth marketing. Professors Ajay Agrawal, Catalini and Avi Goldfarb discuss in details the trade-offs funders and entrepreneurs face in this context in their “Some Simple Economics of Crowdfunding” chapter, recently published by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Hot projects attract a larger crowd The crowdfunding culture is about winning and hopping on projects that will win — and win big. Our propensity to back a project increases the more funds that a project has already accumulated, Prof. Catalini said. In practical terms, the closer a project is to reaching its goal, the more capital will be received. Catalini noted that family and friends are most engaged during the early stages of investment and early weeks of a project, whereas outside backers are most active during the late stages. The lesson here is that encouraging friends and family to back you to demonstrate solid traction after your project’s initial launch may motivate the critical mass of backers to hop on board (bonus if you include pre-sales, see lesson #1). Information disclosure One of the major disincentives of crowdfunding is that competition in your space will immediately be able to identify your market strategy and value propositions before you even enter. Especially in the hardware space where product iterations are far from cheap and time between iteration cycles is greater than software, the incumbent could, in theory, use its access to capital to make their product just as good as yours — or better — in a shorter amount of time. Changes in the VC landscape The explosion of infant ventures that have emerged from crowdfunding technology may have the VC community feeling a bit antiquated. Sam Altman, president of U.S. accelerator Y-Combinator, recently wrote in a blog titled Valuations , “Crowdfunding (probably the most important new force in startup investing) is providing more competition for early-stage investments, and hedge funds and private equity firms are starting to do a lot more late-stage investing.” That means startups now have the ability to receive early-stage, non-dilutive capital on crowdfunding platforms. A commonly known piece of value provided by angel investors and VCs is that they can provide advice to the entrepreneurs they fund. However, this isn’t possible or always relevant when an entrepreneur seeks funding through crowdfunding platforms. As Robert Schiff writes in McKinsey on Society , “Just because you live in the United States doesn’t mean you have very much advice to give an entrepreneur in Uganda.” Prof. Catalini makes the argument that many “crowdfunders” may not be the best advisors for infant startups, whereas VC firms can leverage their expertise to help their portfolio of companies succeed (see http://a16z.com/team/ for a good example of this). By turning to crowdfunding, some startups could be crowding out the mentorship that comes with professional investors. Yes to unauthenticated startups  Not all companies should turn to crowdfunding, though it may seem tempting, especially when founders can receive capital without compromising equity. However, it may not be necessary, depending on the market validation and growth of your venture.

After all, what’s a beautiful post pandemic landscape if you can’t share some good pictures of it? Photo Mode is activated through the pause screen. You can activate it by simply tapping L3 to freeze the action in-game as long you aren’t in a cutscene. For a clear description of how it works, check out a tutorial from Jeff Negus , our in-house editor and videographer:   Camera control, field of view, and depth of field adjustments will help you frame the perfect shot.  Aesthetically, you can add one of ten different color filters and adjust its intensity. You can choose to give your photo a vignette or even select from a selection of eleven different frames. If you like the look of film grain, you can add that as well. There are a ton of options for you to explore.  Photo Mode arrives in Patch 1.01 for The Last of Us Remastered. It will only be available in this PS4 edition of the game. Patch 1.01 will be rolled out globally by the time you get your hands on the game July 29. Let’s see your best photos!

The lucky few are able to join progressive brokerages or powerful teams with in-house mentorship, but far too many will struggle on their own unsure of where to turn or how to start. I reached out to my amazing network around North America for their BEST advice to new agents on how to launch their businesses powerfully and we got the most amazing responses with some common themes. The secrets to success (in real estate AND life) by Sunny Lake 1. Be true to yourself. In doing this, you will attract the kinds of clients that you want to work with, and they will adore and respect the heck out of you. This is one of the most important things you can do in your business and your life in general. It will help you keep balance. It will help you keep perspective. It will help you be successful on your terms. Article continues below Advertise with Inman 2. Take time for you. This job can be so very rewarding, but it can just as easily suck the life out of you. You have to make time for yourself — put it on your calendar and respect that appointment as you would any other appointment. Whatever helps you come back to center, do that — meditate; read; spend time with your family and friends; run; travel — do something that gets you AWAY mentally or physically or both. 3. Build routine into your day. When you have a conventional job, you come to work and have a set of tasks that you need to get done within a certain amount of time. When you are a real estate broker you don’t have that same structure inherent in the job, so you must create that for yourself. Come up with a daily routine that works for you, and stick with it. It’s easy to lose focus and motivation if when you wake up, you don’t know what you need to get done. 4. Treat your business like a business. YOU are your business, and you have to treat yourself that way. I’m not saying that you can’t have fun, you totally should. But you need to remember that this is your job. 5. Learn as much and as often as you can. No one can learn everything, but everyone can learn a lot about a few areas. Find out what you and your clients are passionate about, and never stop learning and growing in these areas. Love technology? Always be striving to learn more about it. Love photography? Take some classes, or get out there and shoot pictures. Always keep your mind open to learning more. 6. Share what you know and learn. Knowledge is wasted if it isn’t shared. Some of the smartest people I know are also the most generous with their knowledge. If you learn about something that may help someone else out, tell them — show them how to do it — help them grow. 7. You don’t have to spend a lot of money to be successful. Yes, you have to spend some money, but you don’t have to go into debt to get started and be wildly successful. Find a couple key programs and services (ask for suggestions) that will work for you and that you’ll use consistently (LOTS have free trial periods, so look around and find the ones that fit), and then implement them. Consistency is key if anything is going to work. But you can find amazing tools that won’t cost more than a few lattes each month. 8. Love your clients. Your clients can make or break you, so learn to love them in ways that they feel it. This is a personal business, so get to know them on a personal level and connect with them. When your clients become your friends, they will also become your advocates. And advocates will tell everyone they know about you and how great you are.

Just tell us why you like travelling solo (in 100 words or less). Entries close July 30! Click here to enter ! It’s the classic superimposed ego shot in front of a really cool landmark. The one snap with that really long arm and as many crammed-in friends as can fit. A crazy wide angle frame with curved edges making the world look like it’s been smashed into a Christmas snow globe. This is the beginning of my explanation of the famed social snap and how to get that perfect traveller “selfie.” I think the advent of the front-facing smart phone camera really changed the way we view ourselves –  literally. About a year ago, the selfie brought about an entirely new travel trend and began to saturate the social media world. Something that began as a bit of a joke turned into an art form of sorts. Who could get the coolest selfie? Is mine cooler than yours? Who could get the craziest wild animal in the background? Who has the best expression or the most extreme adventure activity? From there, it turned into an international craze when Ellen DeGeneres’ infamous Oscars pic hit Twitter. I hope that everyone reading this knows what a selfie is and would think you’ve got a stash of awesome ones in your photo collections. And why not? As travellers, we live pretty cool lives and are all devilishly good-looking. The world should know about it, right? Yes, they should. This is one of my favourites from Taronga Zoo in Sydney : So, how does one perfect this art form? Here are a few easy tricks to help you take that perfect traveller selfie on your next adventure. First off, a super wide-angle camera like a GoPro or Sony handheld make it incredibly easy to get a sweet-looking selfie. The wider the frame, the better. Infinity focus. Try and make sure that your camera doesn’t automatically focus on only you (the subject) but the entire frame. Most cameras have a manual focus feature which can be set to infinity. The GoPro has a built in automatic infinity focus and makes selfies very easy. Get a magnetic wide-angle extension for your smartphone camera. There are lots of really cool magnetic add-ons for smart phones that act as filters for your phone’s camera. One is a wide angle and immediately turns your phone into the perfect selfie device. Aim the phone/camera slightly up at a height just above your head, then tilt it downward to take the snap. This is pretty simple and incredibly helpful in making the selfie look much more impressive than it actually is. Test it out a few times; you should see a difference right away, especially if you’re shooting in front of landscape. Have fun! Put as many people in it as possible, make a funny face, get pets or and food in it, and make it interesting. The more you can stuff into it, the better. The best selfies I’ve seen are usually in places that most people are familiar with, like Machu Picchu or the Taj Mahal. Other good ones often have animals in them. For a long time, one of the most popular photos on Tourism Australia’s Instagram account was of my friend Cameron Ernst and a cheetah. The quick-and-easy selfie is a shining example of how our digital society continues to lean towards the most convenient ways of sharing how awesome we all are. It’s the epitome of the somewhat self-obsessed idea of, “Hey! Look at me and where I am, and how cool it all is, and why aren’t you here too?” What is your best travel selfie? Where was it taken? What were you doing in it? Was it just you or did it include other people or animals? And most importantly: Is it cooler than mine? Tell us and tell the world… just don’t forget that all-important #selfie hashtag! Travelling solo? You could win a $500 travel voucher.

The suit says that the mistaken amputation has caused the man extreme pain, and that his wife also is suffering. The suit names the hospital, a urology group, a medical clinic and two doctors as defendants. It's seeking an unspecified dollar amount. A hospital spokeswoman says the claims lack merit. A lawyer for the physicians says the allegations in a lawsuit filed this week in Birmingham by Johnny Lee Banks Jr. are untrue. The attorney, Will Axon, says the lawsuit is an attempt to damage the reputation of the physicians. Banks and his wife filed the lawsuit this week against Drs. Vincent Michael Bivins and Alan Aikens, their medical groups and a hospital. He claims his penis was wrongly amputated during a circumcision last month. The lawsuit accuses the defendants of medical malpractice, negligence and other wrongdoing. It seeks an unspecified amount of money. The hospital also says the claims are without merit.", "score"=>166.72469, "summaryTitle"=>"Alabama man claims penis mistakenly amputated", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"An Alabama man who went to the hospital for a routine circumcision says doctors mistakenly amputated his penis.

(Please refer to the first image.) Some artists have “that line,” a fluidity with their chosen stylus that separates the terminally mediocre from those whose work is natural and joyful to experience. I won’t entirely claim to be of the former camp, but I certainly can’t summon that certain hand on command. Enter professional illustrator Carly Monardo (who, incidentally, is married to Chris Hastings, creator of the legendary comic  Dr. McNinja ). She and her husband have been long-time supporters of my own little comics enterprise since back in the small times of the early aughts, and I’ve been familiar with her enviable portfolio for years. We needed a complex, multi-character scene depicting a tense boardroom pitch. It had specific, brain-teaser compositional needs, and had to be executed crisply enough to represent a company with the words “pop” and “art” in the name. What followed was nearly a month of trading notes around the clock—and across time zones—based on dozens of reference documents. (Our team even, at one point, supplied her with a three-page short story describing the pitch in question, which may or may not have been the world’s first instance of “B2B fanfic.”) She was virtually unflappable, which is remarkable, given the microscopic level of precious edits I was sending her way. “Move the creases of the CEO’s mouth upwards and to the right about 3px, please refer to my (violently Photoshopped) version of your original.” “The ice cubes in the billionaire’s glass are too small and floating at an unrealistic height within the water; they also are not displacing an amount of water equal to the amount missing from the bottle next to his glass.” I would say we were being a nightmare client, but a client who knows exactly what they want and can articulate it is preferable to one who doesn’t and can’t. (And the rare bird who actually won’t —they’re out there.) We’re stylizing it further now, and will launch with it as the feature illustration on our landing page in September. Needless to say, I’m thrilled with how this collaboration has turned out, and it’s added a layer of richness to be working with familiar faces from along the long path of life. If you need a commercial illustrator, Mrs. Monardo is the one of the most naturally talented, funny, and professional contractors I’ve ever worked with. I’m happy to provide a more detailed endorsement if contacted. —CTO * I don’t say “web cartoonist” any more because if you’re a cartoonist and you’re not on the web, well, that’s like being a Formula One driver who doesn’t have a car.

The dreamy portraits leave viewers confused, even shocked by what they see. That draws them into the photograph, forcing them to consider it thoughtfully and intimately. You can’t help but linger, which is the point. “I want to try and make you spend a little time before you flip the page,” says Jasik , whose portraits of Daniel Arnold, Dan Deacon, Meagan Cignoli and others appear in the August issue of WIRED. “Photography is so omnipresent these days that it’s become disposable, but I want you to have some sort of emotional reaction before you can move on.” Jasik, a New Yorker originally from Poland, has long been a fine arts photographer, and his unique portraiture has increasingly appeared in mainstream magazines. Originally, his colorful style was influenced by post-impressionism. He was drawn to the post-impressionists during an exhibit at the National Galley and struck by their rejection of realism in favor of abstraction. “I feel like detail is kind of a red herring,” he says. “Just because a photographer captures someone’s wrinkles doesn’t mean that they know them. Wrinkles don’t necessary give you insight into who they are. And it if someone has unblemished skin, that doesn’t mean they don’t have character.” Beyond post-impressionists like Degas and Cézanne, Jasik is inspired by those who force us to reconsider the world and how we see it; people like Richard Mosse , who used infrared film to photograph the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and film director David Lynch. “Like David Lynch, I very much want to delve into the undercurrents, now just show you what’s happening,” he says. Jasik also uses his signature style to shoot landscapes. He photographed Las Vegas , for example, using saturated color to make people question the city’s very existence. “I wanted to ask why we think it’s normal to build a giant city in the middle of the desert with no nearby natural water source,” he says. “I want us to think about how this has become normal.” Jasik won’t say much about his technique beyond telling us he builds an “apparatus” around his camera to help create the photos. He’ll tweak the saturation and contrast in post-production, but the effects are created in-camera. For him, technique is important, but he’s also focused on the viewer’s reaction. “I just want to find a way to make them look,” he says. “And then once they’re looking, I hope they can then delve deeper inside.”", "score"=>166.7026, "summaryTitle"=>"Psychedelic Portraits That Demand a Closer Look", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Maciek Jasik uses super-saturated color gradients, motion, and playful focusing to create ethereal portraits that are slightly unsettling.

Kalashnikov Concern, the company responsible for the eponymous gas-operated 7.62 caliber assault rifle known largely around the world as the AK-47, is among the latest Russian-owned entities to be blacklisted by the US government following last Wednesday’s announcement that several Russian banks, energy firms and weapons makers were being targeted by new sanctions. Gun sellers now say the Obama administration’s decision to sanction the company has caused a spike in sale in the week since, with some retailers warning customers that their stocks have been decimated upon the addition of Kalashnikov Concern to the Treasury’s roster of blacklisted businesses. The latest round of sanctions does not bar the selling of Russian-made AK-47s within the US that have already been paid for in full, meaning long-time owners and the distribution companies not in debt to Kalashnikov Concern can continue to operate and offer the weapons as they did ahead of last week’s announcement. Imports of all of the company’s Russian-made weapons are now indefinitely on hold, however, and reportedly has prompted a peak in demand as a result. Blaine Bunting, the president of Maryland gun distributor Atlantic Firearms, told the Huffington Post this week that orders for their AK-47-style rifles and shotguns have \" tripled, if not quadrupled \" since the day sanctions were announced. \" We have 15 employees here, and yesterday we started at 7:30 in the morning and didn't leave until eight at night ,\" he told HuffPo on Tuesday. In all, the website reported, Atlantic Firearms parted ways with its entire stock of over 400 Russian-made guns, causing the distributors to post a warning to would-be buyers on its official site. “ Due to recent import restrictions, we have had a run on our supply of Russian manufactured firearms. We are currently SOLD OUT of the Russian AK47 CAK-132 Wood as of 7/17/14. We are working with our importer to try and acquire what we can but are expecting price increases ,” part of the Atlantic Firearms site reads. Hunter Stuart, a reporter at HuffPo, wrote that similar shops across the US are witnessing the same thing. At Nampa, Idaho’s Armageddon Armory gun shop, for example, the store’s entire inventory of bought 60 Saiga semi-automatic shotguns made by Kalashnikov was bought within days of last week’s announcement. \"We sold out of them instantly,\" he said. Other shops in Oklahoma and North Carolina told Stuart that their stocks were being depleted quickly after the Treasury Department’s announcement. According to Kalashnikov Concern, however, the latest sanctions are only hurting the US market, not Russia’s. “The products of Kalashnikov enjoy great demand in the United States,” the company said in a statement after last week’s announcement. “Preorders on civilian products are three times the annual volume of deliveries. Thus, the sanctions taken against Kalashnikov go against the interests of American consumers.” Also blacklisted by the Treasury in the latest rounds of sanctions are armaments and parts manufactured by Izhmash Research & Production Association of Russia, a centuries-old company known as one of the best-selling firearms manufacturers in the world. RWC Group LLC, the sole company that exports Concern Kalashnikov to the US, said last week that they were refraining from making any immediate comment regarding the sanctions. The company did not respond right away to RT’s request for comment on Friday this week.", "score"=>166.64282, "summaryTitle"=>"Sanctions against Russia spark AK-47 buying frenzy", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Russian-made firearms are reportedly flying off the shelves of American gun stores after the United States Treasury Department announced sanctions last week against the maker of the popular AK-47 rifle.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://rt.com/usa/175652-kalashnikov-sanction-gun-sales/", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "direct", "bit.ly"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1pkKx7j", "lastseen"=>"20140726004241", "page"=>"http://rt.com/usa/175652-kalashnikov-sanction-gun-sales/", "ogtitle"=>"Sanctions against Russia spark AK-47 buying frenzy"}, {"domain"=>"ndtv.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406331015000", "h2"=>["Mahendra Singh Dhoni admits Lord's win against England after 28 years was indeed very special.", "Related Articles", "Latest from Sports", "Latest From Eng vs Ind, 2014", "More from NDTV", "More from Web", "Live Scores & Results", "Fixtures", "Results", "Virat Kohli", "MS Dhoni", "Eng vs Ind, 2014", "Photos", "Videos", "Poll of the day", "Don't Miss"], "h3"=>"© AP", "site"=>"sports.ndtv.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004603", "keywords"=>"England,India,Virat Kohli,MS Dhoni,Lord's, London,Eng vs Ind, 2014,Cricket Mahendra Singh Dhoni Says he has Played his Last Test at Lord's latest Eng vs Ind, 2014 news ", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335563404", "title"=>"Mahendra Singh Dhoni Says he has Played his Last Test at Lord's - Eng vs Ind, 2014 News", "initial"=>"20140725233015", "summaryText"=>"The Lord's victory will raise expectations on Dhoni's team. © AP Mahendra Singh Dhoni has indicated that this will be his last Test series in England.

The Indian captain said the second Test at Lord's, which India won by 95 runs on Monday, was his last at cricket's 'home'. Dhoni's hints are always very subtle. That's also a timely reminder for the national selectors to 'blood' a new man in the hotseat. Asked to reflect on the Lord's victory, India's first after 28 years, Dhoni said: \"Don't know how exactly it feels. It will be my last Test at Lord's. Don't see myself coming back here in I don't know how many years. Definitely a memorable Test match.\" \"Have had close Tests here. Still remember 2007 series where we drew the match because of bad light, and me and Sreesanth were batting at that time. We saved that Test and went on to be victorious in that series. Every match is special and it's great to win Test matches outside India. Being Lord's, yes very special. But at the same time every Test match is special,\" the 33-year-old said. Dhoni's caliber as a Test captain has often come up for debate. Considered as one of the finest leaders in the shorter formats of the game, Dhoni's has been found wanting in Test matches. He was severely criticized when India lost the 2011 Test series in England 4-0. Even at Lord's this time, things started drifting until Ishant Sharma rocked England with a telling spell. England lost five wickets in 33 balls to go down like a pack of cards. Steve Waugh feels Dhoni is \"street-smart\" and Indian selectors could look at split captaincy at some stage. The former Aussie skipper feels Dhoni needs to be more attacking during Tests. It is probably easier said than done with a young team. Dhoni's position as Test captain seemingly remains 'safe' because India don't have a second leader. Virat Kohli needs to address his batting first. Captaincy surely was a burden for this immensely talented Delhi batsman during the Indian Premier League. In England so far, Kohli has run out of luck after promising starts. A man who has always led by his \"gut feeling,\" Dhoni may not get lucky every time. Winning in Lord's will only raise expectations on Dhoni's Team India and the skipper will be under tremendous scrutiny and must get every strategy right. Dhoni has to score runs too and ensure that his place in the team is not questioned. Bigger tests lie ahead in Australia later this year. Australia could very well see Dhoni making some interesting career decisions. But for now, Dhoni is basking in Lord's glory, especially after reverses in Johannesburg and Wellington earlier this season. Dhoni is impressed by the team's motivation levels. \"It (the win) is a result of hard work and effort of the team. I felt in the last couple of series outside India we were in a position to seal victories in one game each in both places, but somehow we were not able to do that. I felt the bowlers put in great efforts in both matches. \"What was important was to keep working hard. Keep giving the same kind of preparation and thinking into the game. And because of that we have sealed the first game for this team. It was fantastic to see the kind of effort and determination from this team,\" Dhoni said. Dhoni believes in a process. Success is always the end result of a solid process. Success is also about continuity. When Dhoni took over as India's T20 captain in September 2007, he tasted success winning the ICC World T20 in South Africa. Dhoni became India's full-time Test captain quite by default. In the fourth and final Test against Australia in Nagpur he took over the captaincy after Anil Kumble was injured and subsequently retired.

Hometown idol Chad Greenway is in small-town heaven, planted in a three-point stance, mesh blue T-shirt soaked and clinging to his torso like cellophane, his face beaming a toothy smile that has a back story of its own. \"On the cones! On the cones!\" the Minnesota Vikings linebacker yells to a pair of grade-schoolers racing to win an agility drill which means everything to each at this very moment. \"Dig! Dig! Ah, good one!\" Greenway yells to the winner, a fist-pumping runt no bigger than the Vikings linebacker was 20-some years ago. When this two-time NFL Pro Bowler returns to host the biggest Greenway Football Clinic yet, Mount Vernon -- population 462 -- comes to him, bringing along a sweeping brood of southeastern South Dakotans. Greenway and his wife, Jennifer Capista, met at the University of Iowa, where he was an All-America linebacker and she ran track and field. They live in Wayzata with their daughters, Maddyn and Beckett. Jennifer is pregnant and expecting another girl. Greenway, 31, is perfectly content being a suburban dad and lone male of the household. Still, even with the fulfillment and security professional football has provided, one senses Greenway will never entirely lose the dirt under his fingernails -- that he, in fact, longs for those 5 a.m. wake-up calls and daily chores like mending fences, cutting hay, grinding feed and opening the hoop barn for bulls to start the calving season. \"I wanted to be in the NFL. I wanted this life,\" he said. \"But you also realize what you're giving up and what you're missing. This is really what I'm made of. It's great to come back. It's so quiet. Kind of takes you back to your childhood and all the things you wanted to become.\" DEEP ROOTS More than 250 third-through-12th graders and their parents attended Greenway's three-hour, freewheeling clinic at the only school in town, where the local star once was a two-way dynamo on a shrink-wrapped 80-yard field unique to such undermanned outposts. But Greenway is home now for reasons beyond his annual camp, helping his parents, Alan and Julie, work the family farm. Alan Greenway, 55, was diagnosed with leukemia on May 10, 2012, and his health has demanded more commitment from all of the Greenways. Alan can herd cattle on his four-wheeler, but much of the labor required to farm 2,000 acres has been delegated to Julie and one of Chad's two older sisters, Kelly. \"My mom, growing up, could do anything my dad could do,\" Greenway said. \"Now that I have daughters, especially, what a great example for my kids. To see her working, and the passion she has for it, going through the tough times with my dad's illness, and see her push through and persevere and make it work somehow.\" That work ethic has served Julie's son well. One of 29 seniors in Mount Vernon's Class of 2001, Greenway uprooted for Iowa and became a two-time All-America whose 416 career tackles rank fifth in Hawkeyes history. And while Greenway has in some ways become a Minnesotan, his roots here are deep and can be conspicuously seen and felt. During his camp, participants wear T-shirts from past practices, others purple Greenway No. 52 jerseys. Their parents are swathed in Vikings hoodies and blankets to buffer the unseasonable chill. When Superintendent Patrick Mikkonen, who oversees a prekindergarten-through-12th-grade enrollment of 244 students, takes a visitor on a tour of the grounds, it includes the \"Chad Greenway Family Press Box.\" Melissa Mebius, mayor of nearby Wessington Springs, is at camp to thank Greenway, who teamed his Lead The Way Foundation with a local radio station and raised $27,500 to help rebuild a daycare center and replace youth sports equipment destroyed two weeks earlier when a tornado ravaged her town. Alan and Julie Greenway are there, too, mingling around the concession stand while former coaches and classmates prepare the grill for post-practice burgers and brats, and Katelyn Grehl, the state's reigning dairy princess, hands out pints of chocolate milk to refresh winded football campers. \"For us here in South Dakota, this is what we're made of,\" Greenway says hours later, sitting in the garage of his parents' farmhouse. \"For me to make it to the NFL, the chances were pretty remote. To have an opportunity like this when I was a kid would have been unbelievable. \"To see the look on the kid's faces when they come to the clinic, it's cool. It's more than just a short clinic; it's an experience. So it was fun.\" Trevor Tovsland, 12, concurs. The incoming seventh-grader lives in Mitchell, the commercial hub of 15,000 people 10 miles east on Interstate 90. His parents enrolled him at Mount Vernon for its football pedigree and intimate schooling of one classroom for all 12 grades. \"Chad proves that just because you're from a rural city, it doesn't mean you can't make it,\" Trevor said. \"He grew up here. He's done so much. He has helped everybody. He's famous. He's just awesome.\" That explains Greenway's joy. Alan Greenway has details on his son's gleaming choppers, mangled during his sophomore year in high school and rebuilt after the Vikings drafted him 17th overall in 2006 out of Iowa. \"He was chasing a girl in the dark and there were no lights in the yard and he ran into a clothesline of (conducting) wire, (which) caught those two and took 'em plum out,\" dad recounted. \"They found them and threw them in milk. We went to the dentist right away. I was there with him. They shoved them back in, had to glue them. But they were kind of messed up and they died. He looked like a jack-o-lantern.\" Please, go on. \"We did the best we could, but when he got his first contract, he got a little work done. They're his teeth, but he got them straightened up.\" 'IN IT TOGETHER' When the NFL star returns to give back, Mount Vernon and his hometown way of life reciprocate. On this day, the cows are out to pasture, and the hog barn is vacant after Greenway's parents sold off the drove. Their unmistakable smell remains potent. So does the absolute stillness where a child could lose himself for hours during the day and listen to coyotes howling miles away at night. \"It's your own little town out here,\" Greenway said. \"No rules.\" Greenway's exemplary work ethic with the Vikings is a byproduct of living off the land, where children are bred to work with no favors asked and none given. \"The best thing about being a farmer, for my dad, was he never had a boss,\" Greenway said. \"He never had anybody to say what you had to do today. Reaping what you sow is getting out of bed and doing it yourself. \"It's really up to me how good I want to be, whether that's being a family guy or being a football player.\" Greenway has bought up surrounding cropland for himself and invested with his parents in more acreage they farm for him. \"Really, we're kind of in it together, which is pretty fun,\" he said. Shared satisfaction and self-determination, though, do not mitigate farming's inherent risks -- drought, starving livestock, fluctuating grain prices. Right now, the crisis is Alan Greenway's health. Doctors aggressively treated his leukemia into remission, but not before a fungus punctured his weakened immune system and invaded his sinuses. The fungus quickly spread to his brain. By mid-June 2012, Greenway was flown from a Sioux Falls, S.D., hospital to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., with a dire prognosis. \"They gave me two weeks to live and sent me home,\" he said. \"I guess I got two years.\" Doctors speculated the dust-borne fungus had settled benignly in his sinuses after years of farm work. \"For some reason, it reversed and every month it got better,\" said Alan Greenway. \"It's amazing.\" He has had two stem-cell transplants in an effort to boost his body's white-blood-cell count and ability to fight infections. There are good days and bad. \"It's kind of sucked,\" he said in an Upper Midwest accent that so resembles his son's, it would be impossible to distinguish the two in a dark room. \"Six weeks ago was better than it is right now. Physical labor, I can't really do any of that. My wife, she's the one that's keeping everything together.\" Undeterred, Alan Greenway plows forward. \"I look ahead. Just bought a new tractor last week,\" he said. \"That's just the way I am.\" His treatment and outpatient care at Mayo have made it more convenient for Greenway to see him regularly, dashing from Wayzata and Winter Park to Rochester whenever he can. Greenway says he is closer to his father today than he has ever been. \"He's always been the guy I've looked up to as a hero, the guy I've wanted to be and never want to let down in my life,\" Greenway said. \"He just continues to prove to me over and over again what makes him so special, just with his fight and his want-to, his zest for life, his love for my mom. \"Those are all the things that I want as a husband and a person. It's pretty cool to see that come from such a great example as your dad.\" Follow Brian Murphy at twitter.com/murphPPress . MOUNT VERNON, S.D.

Fortunately, the citizen science project Cat Tracker allows you to track your cat beyond what we can directly observe. Cats are moody. In the blink of an eye, a cat can change from aloof to affectionate, playful to predatory, carefree to curious. The myth about nine lives is oddly suitable, but not as nine sequential lives. Instead, it is as though cats have nine personalities which results in living nine lives all at once. Now their multifaceted personalities make us laugh with LOL Cats. But the joke is on us. Pet cats remain a mystery living right under our noses. We share our homes with them. We adopt them into our families. And if we let them outside, then there is a significant part of their lives for which we are clueless. Curled up on our laps rests Dr. Jekyll, but out the door goes a stalking Mr. Hyde. A new collaboration between cat owners and scientists seeks to find out where cats go and what they may eat along the way. The scientists of Cat Tracker are a team of professors and students at the NC Museum of Natural Sciences , in NCSU Biological Science ( Your Wild Life ), and at the NCSU Veterinary School . The cat owners so far are mostly in North Carolina, though recruits are now signing up from many other states, and soon in Australia and New Zealand. Cat owners outfit their pet with a tiny satellite tracking device on a special collar. Undergraduate Troi Perkins programs the GPS units, fits them into cases that she makes on a 3-D printer, and then visits owners and helps “harness the little fuzz balls.” People outside of the Raleigh area participate in a Do-It-Yourself ( DIY ) style in four easy steps . Together, a GPS unit and harness costs about $50. Each cat wears the gear for about a week. Then, while their pets feign innocence upon return from numerous excursions that week, the owners remove the collar, attach the GPS unit to their computer, and download the secrets movements of the silent footed. The cat owners submit the tracking information to a public data repository on animal movements, called Movebank . Until now, Movebank was only used by professional researchers. With members of the public engaging in animal tracking, the amount of information will quickly rise. Some participants opt to go one step further in their desire to understand their cat companion. They divert the contents of the litter box from the garbage to specimen cups picked up by the NCSU researchers. These fecal samples will be examined for microbes and DNA from the potential remains of wildlife. To date, Cat Trackers has gathered data on the movement of over 40 cats.  Their goal is to track 1,000 cats. Troi says she most commonly hears Cat Tracker participants say, “Oh my… my cat has traveled over the highway?!” She explains that people are usually surprised by their cat’s outdoor explorations and curious to know whether their cat is a loner or hanging out with their neighbor’s cats. She says, owners “just want to see if their cats are crossing busy roads, visiting other people’s houses, or going into remote wooded areas.” Researchers wonder similar things, particularly about visits to wooded areas. Cats are not necessarily as benign as their purring might make us believe. Cats transmit diseases to humans. Cats eat birds and other wildlife. A study by Smithsonian and US Fish & Wildlife Service researchers gave estimates that cats kill at a minimum of one million birds and seven million small mammals every year. Roland Kays, Director of the Biodiversity Lab at the NC Museum of Natural Science explained that tracking at least a thousand cats will reveal secrets “not only about the typical cat movements, but also about the extraordinary ones.  Given that cats are so common in the country, if even 5% of them are moving out into the nature preserves it could be quite harmful to native wildlife.” Rob Dunn of NCSU’s Your Wild Life explained that “the big result so far is that there are a lot of cats that walk short distances most days and then every so often, for whatever reason, bolt for it often up to a mile before coming right back And then a few cats just seem lost.” On the Cat Tracker website, the cat movements look like starburst pattern in every direction around their home. As residential areas expand adjacent to natural areas, and become increasingly important for biodiversity conservation and for human wellbeing, conflicts between bird-lovers and cat-lovers escalate. Perhaps more information can help find common ground. It was over 9,000 years ago when our ancestors started taming nature. First we learned how to turn wild plants into crops. We stored the harvest, but this brought mice. So then, in the Near East, people domesticated cats to function as mousers. We turned wild cats into pets. We’ve bred them to be fluffy and leisurely, yet fierce and playful. Siamese, Tabby, Calico. Their appearances are as different as their personalities. Lions congregate together in prides. House cats simply have pride. An over-abundance of it. All of our pet cats retain their heritage, balancing a dual identity of being a little wild, a little tame. Cat Tracker provides an in-depth peek into the behaviors of cats, whether predatory, social, or antisocial. Dunn told me that one household with nine cats just signed up. As more owners with multiple cats participate, perhaps we’ll gain insight into the idiom about herding cats and finally come to grips with the futile attempts to control this chaotic group.

Its rule would allow 30 food-related fundraising days per school year that wouldn't meet the new healthy nutritional standards, which call for more healthy options and less junk foods that could contribute to the nation's child obesity problem. The pushback is not about students' taste buds, but their wallets. Food fundraisers are a crucial source of revenue for schools, state education officials say. \"Tough economic times have translated into fewer resources and these fundraisers allow our schools to raise a considerable amount of money for very worthwhile education programs,\" the Georgia Department of Education wrote in a recent press release . \"While we are concerned about the obesity epidemic, limiting food and beverage fundraisers at schools and school-related events is not the solution to solving it.\" The statement called the federal guidelines on fundraisers \"an absolute overreach of the federal government.\" Tennessee also plans to allow 30 food-fundraising days that don't comply with federal standards per school year. Idaho will allow 10, while Illinois is slowly weaning schools off their bake sales, hoping to shrink them from an annual 36 days to nine days in the next three years. Florida and Alabama are considering creating their own exemption policies. State-level resistance to the healthy eating regulations has support in Washington. This spring, Republicans tried to delay implementation of new school cafeteria requirements by one year through a proposed 2015 Agriculture Department spending bill. Proponents of the requirements, meanwhile, have scoffed at Georgia's suggestion of a War on Brownies. \"Pushing back on so-called federal government overreach by allowing a huge number of unhealthy school fundraisers is not only bad politics, it's irresponsible, puts children's health at risk, and undermines parents' efforts to feed their children healthfully,\" Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest told Politico on Friday. \"There are plenty of healthy fundraising options that are practical—and as or more profitable than selling junk food.\" Sure, they could be practical.

The medical examiner's office found a fracture on the child's skull and have yet to determine the cause of death. Alicia Johnson-Taylor, 24, and Corey Carr, 25, are both charged with failure to report the death of a child. According to the criminal complaint: Authorities were called to the family's home in the 2100 block of S. 5th Street around 2 p.m. on July 17 for an \"unresponsive person\".  Firefighters found an infant in one of the bedrooms laying in a playpen. The infant's lips were blue and body was cold and stiff. Carr told police that he was the father of the child, and that he gave the baby a pacifier around 9 a.m. and laid the baby on his back. When he woke up at noon, he found the baby on his stomach, and noticed that baby was \"unresponsive and blue\". Carr told investigators he immediately ran outside yelling, \"our son is dead\" to the child's mother and family friend.   A 28-year-old woman and family friend, who was inside the home, told firefighters that she had been there for at least 45 minutes after learning of the infants death, and finally called 911 because \"no one else would\". She told investigators that everyone in the home knew the child was dead.  In a police interview, the 28-year-old family friend said that she and Johnson-Taylor were leaving out for an errand when Carr ran out behind them saying the baby was dead.  The women went back inside and touched the infant. The 28-year-old said the child's body was cold and that the mother shook the baby trying to wake him up. The family friend said she told the parents to call 911, but they refused. Carr told investigators that he did not call 911 right away. Johnson-Taylor told police she was the child's mother and that she had been \"in and out\" of the home all day and was leaving again when she learned of the baby's death. She told investigators that the baby had been born addicted to methadone because of her own \"Percocet problems\".  An autopsy revealed a recent skull fracture above the baby's left eye. An official cause of death is pending and the child's body is being examined for other possible injuries.  Stay tuned to CBS 58 for updates.   ", "score"=>166.24779, "summaryTitle"=>"Milwaukee parents charged in death of two-month-old child", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"The parents of a deceased two-month-old baby boy are facing criminal charges after being suspected of abuse.

American Top Team ’s Lawler will meet the surging Brown in the UFC on Fox 12 main event on Saturday at the SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., with the winner all but assured a shot at reigning Ultimate Fighting Championship welterweight titleholder Johny Hendricks . Lawler has posted a 4-1 record since returning to 170 pounds, a contentious unanimous decision defeat to Hendricks the lone blemish. Long established as one of MMA’s premier power punchers, the 32-year-old last fought at UFC 173 in May, when he scored a third-round technical knockout on Jake Ellenberger at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Brown has rattled off seven consecutive victories in emerging as the unlikeliest of title contenders. The onetime journeyman last competed at a UFC Fight Night event in May, when he took down the talented but enigmatic Erick Silva with third-round punches at the U.S. Bank Arena in Cincinnati. Brown has not tasted defeat since November 2011. Sherdog.com touched base with a number of professional fighters and trainers to gauge their opinions on the UFC on Fox 12 headliner: Brian Foster : Well, I definitely have some insight to this fight. With Lawler being a big part of my win over Brown, I don’t see Matt standing any chance whatsoever in this fight. Not to take anything away from what he has done as of late; he has earned this ass whoopin’. Lawler is an elite striker who has very underrated wrestling and jiu-jitsu. That being said, no matter where this fight goes, Lawler takes the cake. Kudos to Matt for making it this far, and I wish him well in recovery. Igor Araujo : Bombs, bombs, grenades and rockets, after all. I have Robbie winning after five rounds. Jeff Hougland : I’m going to pick Brown to do his best Terminator impression and walk forward through Lawler’s bombs and land knees and elbows for a late-round doctor’s stoppage due to a cut. J.J. Ambrose : These guys both have ridiculous standup and KO power. Both also have the X-factor where they weather a vicious storm and come back to put their opponents away. I’m predicting an amazing, barn-burning fight that ends with a double knockout. Cameron Diffley : Lawler-Brown has no other choice but to be an exciting fight. I see Brown finding angles, mixing his takedowns, clinch and striking and working his way to a one-sided decision. Beneil Dariush : Lawler wins. Everything Brown does well, Lawler does better. Tom Lawlor : What can Brown do for you? Provide the “Fight of the Night” and win in impressive fashion. Tom DeBlass : I have to go with Lawler by decision. James Vick : Lawler wins by TKO. Joe Duarte : I have to go with Lawler in this one. He gave Hendricks a hell of a fight. Jason Dent : I love to watch both these fighters perform, that’s for sure, but I’m going with “Ruthless” in this one. Brown won’t be able to take him down, and Robbie loves a guy who will stand and bang with him. I believe Matt’s style just is not a good matchup for Lawler. Robbie wins either by TKO, KO or referee stoppage. Both these guys are mean and like to finish fights, so I personally don’t see this going the distance. Mike Ciesnolevicz : Ever since the first time I trained with Robbie in Iowa, I knew he was one of the most talented guys in the MMA world. I’m glad he is able to finally show everyone outside the practice room just how good he is. Brown has proved he is no joke. He has decently well-rounded skills, but his endurance and determination make him the fighter he is. Brown will need that against Lawler because I believe Robbie has a more dangerous skill set. I think Brown’s aggressive pace is going to lead him right into some big counters by Robbie. Lawler wins by KO in round one after some exciting exchanges. Gabe Ruediger : This is one of the few fights where you can guarantee an entertaining fight. Both guys are tough as nails and like to scrap. I’m going with Lawler, though. His power and tenacity, I think, will be too much for Brown. Even If I’m wrong, though, it’s going to be a great fight. Photo: Jeff Sherwood/Sherdog.com Brown has momentum. Ricardo Liborio : Lawler wins in a possible “Fight of the Year.” Mike Rhodes : Brown is as tough as it gets and on a crazy win streak, but his body is soft. Lawler used to be from my state, the great state of Iowa. He will throw left kicks to the body and head, ultimately leading to a TKO late in the first round or early in the second to earn another shot at Johny. Ray Elbe : Lawler-Brown is going to be an all-out war. Lawler takes it by decision, beating Brown to the punch after eating some brutal leg kicks. Caros Fodor : I’m going with my boy Brown in this one. I’ve spent a lot of time with Matt, and he is a beast. His pressure is crazy, and I believe it will break Robbie later in the fight. Mitch Clarke : Lawler wins by TKO. I think he’s a better version of Brown, with more natural knockout power. That will lead to the fight being competitive in the beginning before Lawler pulls ahead. Robert Drysdale : Brown wins. Erik Paulson : Wow, what a fight. Both are totally tenacious fighters with the will and trickery to win. Endurance is the key. Robbie has explosive KO power in every punch. Game plan implementation and endurance will prevail. It’s a tossup, but I think Robbie will win. I can’t wait to eat wings and yell. Javier Vazquez : I love both of these guys. Lawler has been around forever and Brown has been fighting great lately. It comes down to Lawler’s punching power and Brown’s pressure and conditioning. I’m 50/50 on this match, but I’ll go out on a limb and say Brown wins an exciting fight, probably by decision. Wilson Reis : I have Brown winning by unanimous decision. Ryan Benoit : I’m picking Lawler. Sick fight. It’s going to be a war. Both guys can swing, but I’ve got “Ruthless” in this one. I want to see Hendricks-Lawler 2. Keith Berry : I’m a big fan of Brown, but I believe Lawler will get the nod. Benji Radach : Lawler wins by TKO.

The audio, recorded without Waters' knowledge, was handed over to Ohio State on July 9th, more than a month after Ohio State had initiated its investigation into the culture of the band. From  The Dispatch : Context behind the recording is limited, but the 23-page investigation report says the student was called into Waters’ office along with Christopher Hoch, the associate director of the band, during the week of Sept. 23, 2013. Investigators wrote that there had been a disagreement during practice.  In the recording, Waters does not sound too pleased. After what sounds like a door slamming, Waters gets down to business. Waters:  Alright, Kyle, who is he? What is his position here? Student : Associate director. Waters : And what am I? Student : Head director. Waters : And you fucking better realize who you’re dealing with. We told you to do something on the field and you outright disrespected him and me. Now, this will not stand. We tell you to stand on your head, and as drum major, you’ll stand on your goddamn head if you want to be drum major. Do you understand? Student : Yes I do. Waters : Are we completely clear?

Waters : That's it. Goodbye. Underhanded tactics to record somebody without their knowledge, and you can almost feel Kyle's hidden smirk as the tape rolls.

According to the", "content"=>"Social media is fraught with legend, hysteria, and mass confusion. Because of its intensely personal nature, we tend to approach social media with a lot of strong feelings about its effectiveness, lack thereof, best practices, and how things should be done. Since most of us use Facebook, we think we know how effective it will be, or what kind of posts garner the most attention and interaction. Since we have a Twitter account, we have a sense of knowledge about how it works, and what a business should do (or not do) on Twitter. All that is great, but how much of our social media behavior is founded upon fact? I decided to dig into the data and do some research. What I’ve extracted below are five surprising data points that will have a profound effect on how you approach social media. 1. Email marketing has an ROI of 4,300%. Source: Direct Marketing Association What? A statistic about email? You thought this was about social media, right? My title is “Five Shocking Facts That Will Change Your Entire Approach to Social Media.” This statistic qualifies as shocking, and it impacts the way we approach on social media. The basic fact is this: Email marketing has a huge ROI — way better than any social media marketing ROI can ever dream of achieving. Compare 4,300% that with the ROI of social media, which is crawling around on the floor. Is there even a comparison? Take a look at this chart, released by Custora in 2013 . They surveyed the owners of ecommerce sites to find out where these sites got their customers. Here are the top six sources: Paid and organic search have the highest customer acquisition percentages. The next biggest contender is email. Based on its ROI — higher than paid and organic search — it’s a no brainer. Email marketing is awesome. According to the chart above, the fascinating thing about email marketing is that its acquisition rates are rising dramatically. It has quadrupled over the past four years. Email marketing’s effectiveness far outranks any social media platform, and its growth outstrips them. Even the customer lifetime value (CLV) of social media is hardly worth a second glance. Again, email marketing crushes social media by a huge margin: Simply put, email marketing is way more effective than social media marketing. It has greater effectiveness, better ROI, and higher CLV. Learn this lesson: Spend more time and money on email marketing than on social media marketing. 2. YouTube has the highest engagement and lowest bounce rate. Source: Shareaholic Whenever we think of “social media,” we automatically think of Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. What about YouTube? Check out these engagement stats! Average time on site: 227 seconds Average pages per visit: 2.99 Average bounce rate: 43.19% How does this stack up against the rest of the social media landscape? Decide for yourself: The Shareaholic analysis is based on post-click behavior, which refers to clicking on a link that a friend shares socially. As the Shareaholic analysis stated , “YouTube is the undisputed champion. YT drives the most engaged traffic.” YouTube deserves more of your social media time and effort. You can’t afford not to put more work into creating and adding videos. The more YouTube content, the more you’ll engage your potential customers. Learn this lesson: If you want engaged traffic, spend time optimizing YouTube. 3. Facebook drives more referrals than any other social platform. Source: Shareaholic Want to know which social media site sends you the most amount of traffic? It’s Facebook — by far. Shareaholic analyzed metrics taken over four months, measuring the effectiveness of social media platforms. There was no contest. Facebook crushed the competition, asserting itself as the most powerful social media referral engine on the planet. Companies gripe and complain over the way that Pages have been squashed in the Facebook algorithm. I get that. Facebook wants more ad revenue. But even though page interaction is shrinking, there’s nothing shrinking about the number of referrals that Facebook continues to drive. Simply stated, Facebook still drives more traffic than any other social media site, soaring way above its nearest referral competition, Pinterest. The reason why I’ve included this in my list of facts is because many marketers have become disillusioned with Facebook. Kevan Lee of Buffer writes: Nowadays, when I endeavor to check my Facebook statistics, I do so with the window open, birds singing, a pint of ice cream at my desk, and party jams playing on my jambox….Checking Facebook statistics has been bad news for a lot of us lately as we wrestle with declining numbers and shrinking reach. While Kevan is staving off Facebook depression with ice cream parties and fresh air, Eat24 just decided to end the relationship with a “How dare you!” The super long breakup letter that went into overtime with a P.P.P.S.S.S. was full of foodie talk and hurt feelings. But they were gone from Facebook for good. If you have a fan base below 10,000 (that’s most of us), and only 28 interactions per post, please don’t be discouraged, don’t binge eat, and don’t write a breakup letter. You’re right where you ought to be, as ranked by Social Baker’s average interaction chart . And if you’re in an unsexy industry like finance or telecom, you can expect your average post interaction to be lower, than say, an alcohol or fashion site. In spite of the apparent downward spiral of Facebook metrics, I suggest not giving up on Facebook. Though it is fickle, and though your page isn’t featured at the top of everyone’s news feed, and though you may have to turn up your party music while you check your stats, Facebook is still giving you referrals. As Kevan’s brilliant article concluded — “A counterintuitive way to combat Facebook reach: Stop caring about it.” Learn this lesson: Stick it out with Facebook. 4. Pinterest pins are worth 78 cents each. Source: Piquora First off, a Pinterest disclaimer (or two), and then a Pinterest happy dance. The first disclaimer is this — Pinterest has high bounce rate (53%) and low engagement. Disclaimer number two: Pinterest doesn’t work for everyone. If you are into food, crafts, photography, weddings, design, fitness, humor, travel, fashion, and inspirational quotes, then Pinterest is killer. It holds promise for some, but not for all. The happy dance is this — Pinterest is the second biggest social media referral platform. Though it trails Facebook distantly, it still beats out Twitter, YouTube, Google+, and LinkedIn by a sizeable margin. Now, let’s talk about ROI. Pinterest, as it turns out, does have one. But it’s a delayed reaction. When a pinner curates his or her pinboard, it takes a while for there to be social buildup, let alone revenue. Unlike Twitter, which has a short half-life, Pinterest visits increase as time goes on. It’s like wine. The older, the better. As it turns out, the revenue doesn’t start happening until more than two months after pinning. Pinners spend more time exploring other people’s pinboards then they do searching for stuff offsite to pin. The average Pinterest pin gets 10 repins, but it takes time for those pinners to start repinning pins. This leads to a corresponding delay in revenue. Pinterest is money, but it’s slow money. It’s like investing in a CD or a bond. The egg just takes a little while to hatch. Learn this lesson: Use Pinterest. And be patient. 5. 65% of Twitter users expect a response in under two hours. Source: Lithium Customers use Twitter like a company hotline. If you don’t respond within minutes, you’re toast. Here are the lofty chronological expectations of Twitter users, in all their statistical glory: Image from Hubspot. The Lithium study that produced this statistic had the headline, “Consumers Will Punish Brands that Fail to Respond on Twitter Quickly.” The flip side, “consumers will reward brands that harness Twitter’s power to meet their rising expectations.” What kind of punishment are we talking about? “38% feel more negative about the brand.” As a result, they may no longer purchase from the company. “60% will take unpleasant actions to express their dissatisfaction…publicly shaming the brand on social media” In other words, they may spread their grief further on Twitter. It’s easy to tweet off a 140-character-or-less gripe about the company. “74 percent of customers who take to social media to shame brands believe it leads to better service.” What’s in it for brands who are on the ball, and who respond to Tweets instantaneously? 34 percent are likely to buy more from that company; 43 percent are likely to encourage friends and family to buy their products; 38 percent are more receptive to their advertisements; 42 percent are willing to praise or recommend the brand through social media. There’s a lot to gain by a quick response, and a lot to lose if you don’t. So if you get that Twitter notification on lunch break, don’t wait. Step on it, respond right away, and please your customers’ socks off. Learn this lesson: If you’re going to use Twitter, stay on top of it. Conclusion Here are the five lessons we need to learn For right now, spend more time and money on email marketing than on social media marketing. If you want engaged traffic, spend time optimizing YouTube. Stick with Facebook. Use Pinterest. And be patient. If you’re going to use Twitter, stay on top of it. Facts are indisputable, and the action points are obvious. Let’s not get lost in the romance and novelty of social media. Let’s stay clear headed, smart, and engaged. There’s power in social media, and we need to handle it in the right way. What are some of the most compelling social media statistics that you’ve heard?

While cheering on his son Devante, who is currently on the books at Manchester City, Cole noticed a 16-year-old Shaw in full flight and was hugely impressed by what he saw. Since then, he has followed the left-back’s fledgling career with interest. As such, Cole was delighted when he signed for United in June and, having watched his early endeavours during this summer’s Tour 2014 alongside fellow new recruit Ander Herrera, the Treble winner is excited by what the future has in store. “I think we’ve already seen that Ander and Luke will fit in very well,” Cole told ManUtd.com . “They’re two really good players. We know the club have liked Ander for some time and I remember watching Luke play against my son three years ago. Look at him now, playing for Manchester United - it is phenomenal.

IT’S TIME TO GO TO THE GODDARN MOVIES. if you’re in the states and the summer’s wearing you down, take a break and take in some film at a (hopefully) nice cool, dark theater. i pimped “the dance of reality” a few weeks ago…if you missed my pimp, read it HERE , get out there and see it while you can, and get your dome-piece blown…seriously. i’ve never recommended a film more in my life. except maybe the other movie i wrote about that week…i’d shared the trailer how i stumbled across its existence, but i was able to attend the NY premiere the other night. and it’s amazing. it’s just as good – if not more – than i expected it to be, so now i bring it to you. it’s called “ ALIVE INSIDE ” and it’s a documentary by michael rossato bennett. in short, it’s about the power of music and how it can bring those suffering from dementia and alzheimer’s to a state of connectedness and joy that NO medication or other treatment/therapy can do. but it’s also a *profound* statement about the problem with culture and society these days, and how we view the elderly and medication. it talks about a lot of things, but shines a bright light on how the system is just plain fucked. BUT it’s not just doom and gloom. there’s a ton of hope, too…it’s a 3-cry film. some of the characters and imagery will melt your brainheart, and will inspire great conversation. i got into a discussion afterwards with a few musicians and, given everything i’d been writing about in my book (including the Fraud Police), this film is HEAVY ANTIDOTE for any artists out there wondering if their work will ever make even a little practical difference in the world. the answer is a resounding FUCK YES. so, verdict: this is going to be one of the most powerful films of the summer. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. especially for musicians. but really, everybody. go. go. go…it’s in about 70 cinemas around the globe. all listed on their website . this is a teeny indie film that needs all the help it can get to push it into the world so if you go, spread the word. hell, IF YOU FIND A SHOWING AND GO, TELL ME HERE OR ON TWITTER . I WANT TO KNOW. here’s their facebook , and their twitter’s @aliveinsidefilm . here’s the trailer : while i’m at it, here are TWO OTHER FILM THINGS…!!!! tomorrow afternoon at the brattle theatre, SATURDAY the 26th, there’s a documentary about martin bisi’s recording space in brooklyn, BC studio (as well as a Q&A with martin once you see it). the doc’s titled “ SOUND AND CHAOS ” and is a look back on the 30-year history of where we recorded the first dresden dolls’ record. when we went in there, it’d already seen luminaries like swans, sonic youth, and feotus to name a few, and a lot’s happened in the 10+ years since. i haven’t seen it yet but i’m told there’s some CLASSIC dolls’ footage in there. the trailer (featuring mr. BRIAN VIGLIONE!!!)… …and here’s the facebook event and where to get your tickets . hoorahs. BONUS: later that night, martin’s performing at the lilypad with black fortress of opium. info at facebook . und! another film i caught the premiere of recently is “ THE HUNDRED-FOOT JOURNEY ” which was produced by my friend juliet blake from TED and co-produced by steven spielberg and oprah. DYYAAMMMMM!! it’s based on the novel of the same name, and follows a family from india who relocate to the rural south of france and open a restaurant…a restaurant right across the street from a michelin-star old-skool place where dame helen mirren plays the snotty-as-fuck head chef. and, you guessed it: love, hilarity, and lots of really sexy shots of food ensue. plus, the acting is suPREME. the trailer … let me know if you go see ANY OF THESE and what you think. maybe we could have some discussion in the comments here…especially in regards to “alive inside” (as there’s SO much to talk about). before i go, let’s take a hop skip and a jump from film over to the stage for a moment. TWO of my friends are doing some good old fashioned THEATER and both are using kickstarter. firstly, there’s grand theft drummer & director MICHAEL MCQUILKEN, who’s bringing some radness to NYC with his company, OldSoundRoom. they’re working on a project based on short stories by…NEIL GAIMAN. they’re already at a little over $13k (of a $15k goal) and it’s a great way to support local theater and a motherfucker who puts his heart all in. go go go and behold some wonderful rewards… then we have jason… i don’t think a kickstarter pitch video has ever made me tear up, but this one does. i’m also in it, and part of the story, but that’s not why at all. this is one of my best friends, JASON WEBLEY (who many of you will know if only as my twin sister, evelyn), and he’s amazing. and the connector of all things. and THIS thing he’s worked on and embarking with is a really noble one. please take a moment to go here and take in this beautiful project that will make a lot of music happen from a lot of people. (including grand theft bass wielder jherek bischoff!!!) he just launched it the other day and has already tripled his initial goal of $11,111 but that just means more and more good will happen.

But sadness turned to shock when I learned how John Rehm died.   After years of Parkinson's slowly robbing him of most of his functions — he could no longer feed himself or use his arms and legs — Rehm asked his doctor for help. He wanted to die. But Rehm's physician was based in Maryland, not one of the handful of states where doctors are permitted to provide their terminally ill patients with life-ending medication for a quick, peaceful and painless death. His only option: refuse all food and water. Death by dehydration. It took 10 days. ( MORE:  A Husband Weighs the Toughest Decisions ) “We don't let our little animals suffer and people shouldn't have to suffer,” Diane Rehm told NBC News. And because Rehm says her husband “felt betrayed” by his doctor and that his suffering was “unnecessary,” she's gone public. She is now part of the growing aid in dying (or assisted dying) movement which believes in the right of the terminally ill to end their lives with dignity. Over the past 40 years, according to Gallup, public support has grown from 53 percent to 70 percent for a doctor “being allowed to end a patient's life by some painless means if the patient and his or her family requests it.” But when the phrase “doctor-assisted suicide” is used, support is only 51 percent. Assisted Suicide Vs. Aid In Dying “Aid in dying and assisted suicide have nothing to do with each other,” says Barbara Coombs Lee, an attorney and President of Compassion & Choices , the group dedicated to expanding and protecting the rights of the terminally ill. “One is a medical practice and the other is a felony.\" In Montana, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and one county in New Mexico where right-to-die is the law, assisted suicide is outlawed. ( MORE:   How to Make Your End-of-Life Wishes Known ) “It's like calling surgery a stabbing or chemotherapy poison,” says Coombs Lee, co-author of the nation's first death-with-dignity law in Oregon. Just as boomers have been central to the civil rights, women's rights and gay rights movements, they are now driving the aid in dying effort. Coombs Lee says there's a reason: \"It's the boomers' personal experience with the deaths of their parents that has opened their eyes, awakened them to the harm [of not having the choice to end your own life, if you're terminally ill]. And because of that, they are starting to think of their own end-of-life plans.” Coombs Lee began fighting for death with dignity after she was exposed to “good deaths” and “bad deaths” as an ICU/ER nurse and physician assistant. She says she participated in a number of deaths she would not consider “good,” including “tying people's hands to bed rails so they wouldn't pull out their tubes or invading their bodies with very burdensome painful procedures.\" ( MORE:  End-of-Life Lessons for Nelson Mandela's Family—And Yours ) Sometimes, she says, she thinks of her work as \"redemption for some of the wrongs I did on dying people.” Coombs Lee adds: “It's immoral for society to turn its back on the terminally ill and say 'Fend for yourself!. Get a gun! Jump off a balcony! Don't bother our doctors with your desire for a peaceful death!'” A Watershed Moment Historians may look back at July 2014 as a watershed moment for aid in dying. Advocates like Coombs Lee have their eyes on the British House of Lords, where a major debate is underway on a bill allowing doctors to prescribe a lethal dose to terminally ill patients judged to have less than six months to live. It has attracted high-profile religious support from no less than South African Nobel Laureate Desmond Tutu and the former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey, who dropped his long-standing opposition to aid in dying, saying that by opposing reform, the Church “risks promoting anguish and pain, the very opposite of a Christian message of hope.” Writing in the British newspaper The Observer, Tutu said: “I have been fortunate to spend my life working for dignity for the living. Now I wish to apply my mind to the issue of dignity for the dying.” The 82-year-old retired Anglican Archbishop's interest in this issue may have been fueled by the final days of his close friend and colleague, former South African President Nelson Mandela , who was reported to have been kept on life-support amid a family dispute over his care and forced to sit with politicians for a photo-op before his death last year. “What was done to Madiba (the tribal name for Mandela) was disgraceful,” Tutu wrote, noting that the debate on the aid to dying bill came on July 18, Mandela Day in South Africa — what would have been Mandela's 96 th  birthday. After 10 hours of emotional debate in a packed House, the bill now goes to committee but would not become law without government backing. British Prime Minister David Cameron says he's not \"convinced\" by the arguments for legalized aid to the dying. Conflicting Views About The British Bill In an interview with the BBC, theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, who suffers from a motor neuron disease, is almost entirely paralyzed and talks through a speech generating device, said: “If you have a terminal illness and are in great pain, then you have the right to choose to end your life...it is discrimination against a disabled person to deny him the right to kill himself that able-bodied people have.” Hawking is 72 and was given two or three years to live when he was in his early 20s. So he was asked by the BBC: since the doctors got that wrong, isn't there a danger that people who choose death could go on to a long and productive life? “That is a decision the individual has to make. It is wrong for the law to take away that option,” he said. But the British bill also has its share of critics, including the current Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. He worries that changing the law could put vulnerable people under pressure to end their lives “so as not to be a burden\" and “it would leave the sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of elderly people.\" A prominent cancer specialist, Karol Sikora, warned of “death squads” should aid to dying become law, by “putting the decision in the hands of doctors.” Invoking the Hippocratic Oath Whenever assisted dying is debated, advocates and critics alike invoke the Hippocratic Oath (“do no harm”) to support their case. Surgical oncologist and cancer researcher Katherine Morris' first patient to ask her for help in dying was 53-year-old Cody Curtis, suffering from terminal liver cancer. Curtis' end-of-life experience was documented in the film,  How to Die in Oregon. “Cody very clearly taught me that harm for her would have been taking away the control,\" Morris said on The Diane Rehm Show. \"It would have been saying you have to wait and linger in a state of unconsciousness or pain, you have to know that your children and your family are going to watch the suffering. And for her, that would have been the harm. So what she taught me was that harm is different for every single one of us.” The Movement Now Where is the assisted dying movement in this country in 2014? Coombs Lee says even though progress is being made, “it's like the early days of the women's movement when women would meet at the kitchen tables of America and talk about their experience...we're still in the consciousness-raising mode.” Having just experienced the excruciating final days with her husband, Diane Rehm doesn't need her consciousness raised. A host who has devoted her public radio career to being an impartial interviewer on the most divisive issues, this one is too personal for her to remain a neutral observer. Not only has she devoted one of her recent broadcasts to this wrenching topic — she shared the circumstances surrounding John's death and why he decided to refuse all food and water — she's also writing a book about it, On My Own , that will be out next year. Rehm believes “each of us has the right to die with dignity” and says she plans to “move this issue forward with everything I have to honor John for the choice he made.”", "score"=>165.92358, "summaryTitle"=>"Choosing Death: Aid in Dying Gains Support", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"The deaths of John Rehm and Nelson Mandela bring attention to the Aid in Dying movement.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.nextavenue.org/blog/choosing-death-aid-dying-gains-support", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/UnMqHT", "lastseen"=>"20140726004552", "page"=>"http://www.nextavenue.org/blog/choosing-death-aid-dying-gains-support", "ogtitle"=>"Choosing Death: Aid in Dying Gains Support"}, {"domain"=>"theroot.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406319923000", "h2"=>"0 New Stories Since Your Last Visit", "h3"=>["View All New Stories", "Recent Videos"], "site"=>"www.theroot.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004702", "keywords"=>"Stephen A.

This 13-year-old girl was asleep with her Samsung Galaxy S4 sitting next to her when it began to over heat and smolder under her pillow. She says she woke up once in the middle of the night when she thought she smelled something. Barely awake, and thinking nothing of it, she fell back asleep. In the morning, she realized the source of the smell could've burned her face off. If the fire didn't do the job, asphyxiation could've really made matters worse. What apparently happened was that phone's battery had swollen up in the middle of the night to a point where it caught fire. The battery was actually a replacement, and not one of Samsung's. Nevertheless, Samsung does come with a warning about not covering their products with bedding or thick clothing, which seems a little insane when you think about where phones usually go: your pocket. I wonder what Samsung considers thick clothing. In my opinion, blue jeans would fall into that category, which I think most people own, if not continually carry their phones in. Unless they assume we're all carrying our cell phones in fanny packs with the zipper open. Come to think of it, that sounds pretty stylish! Regardless, Samsung consumers have complained about similar issues in the past , so really the signs were already there. Apple investors just clicked their heels. Maximum Overdrive taught me to never trust anything mechanical or electronic, but we still have yet to truly learn our lesson. Next time, let's all lock our phones away in a safe and throw it in a river until you need it again.

I have eyes that are deep brown and almond-shaped. My maternal grandparents are immigrants who left their small village and came to America with the hope of creating a better life for future generations. They lived in California and worked in agriculture, and my mother was the first person in her family to attend college. Chances are, the thought of my ethnicity has crossed your mind by this point—race is one of the most basic descriptors, so it’s normal to try and come to a conclusion in order to construct a basic identity for me. However, in my case, people are usually wrong—I have lived my entire life experiencing instances of racial misidentification. I am not Mexican, Italian, Puerto Rican, or black (some of the most common assumptions). People have projected various stereotypes onto me, spoken to me in languages they assumed I understood, and thrown around various racial comments in reference to their assumptions. So… what am I? My father is white, mostly of English descent, and my mother is Japanese. Both of my parents grew up in the United States, and I was raised without much connection to Japanese culture. I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, a fairly progressive and liberal part of the country. The area I live in is predominantly white, however, and often I’m on the receiving side of an attempt to identify and understand my ethnic appearance. This has always made me self-conscious, and has been a constant reminder that I stood out. “Hey, do you speak Spanish?” a co-worker recently asked me. “Nah, I took it in high school, but who ever remembers that,” I replied. She laughed and nodded. “So like, do people ever come up to you and just start speaking in Spanish anyway though?” I recalled an instance two weeks earlier, when an associate from a different department approached me, speaking several sentences in Spanish before my blank expression prompted her to switch into fluent English instead. “Yeah, it’s happened a few times. I don’t know why though, I’m not Hispanic.” She stopped cleaning the counters and stared at me. “You’re not?” I shook my head, hoping we could leave it at that. “So like, what are you then?” she asked. “I’m half Japanese and half white.” She eyed me suspiciously. “Are you lying to me? Is this a joke?” I laughed it off and shook my head. “No, I swear I’m Asian.” “You don’t look Asian,” she said, “no offense.” I shrugged. Being racially misidentified always makes me question my own assertion of my identity. I’ve been told that I look a variety of races, and more than a few times I’ve been told that I look non-white but unidentifiable beyond that. I have never had a solid tie to any ethnic identity. I’ve never really “felt” Japanese. I don’t know how to speak Japanese, and I can’t say I even know that much about the culture beyond the food and family values. My mother’s parents don’t speak English, so I have never had a real conversation with them. To some degree, I’ve never really felt white either. Being white isn’t a tangible thing—it exists in privilege, status, and many other advantages that are easy to see from the outside but hard to identify from the inside. Toeing the line is a strange sensation. But what does it even mean to embody your race? So much of what is expected of ethnic groups stems from stereotypes. Yes, I am quiet, studious, good at math, and I play a string instrument—but that isn’t because I’m Asian. My Asian mother is outgoing, outspoken, and avoids doing calculations in her head at all cost. My white father is a soft-spoken, reserved software programmer. Most of the “Asian” traits I embody are inherited from my father. It used to bother me deeply when my white friends would list 5 or 10 ethnic groups they claimed distant ancestral affiliation with. You can call yourself one thing and nobody’s ever going to doubt it or get it wrong, I would think, why would you try and complicate that? Most of the time when I’m misidentified, it’s a simple case of making a snap judgment without thought, like when a high school teacher thought a Korean accompanist I performed with at an assembly was my mother. These are associations made in an attempt to understand, to maybe validate the image of myself that others hold. Sometimes, though, comments about my race walk a dangerous and offensive line. There are some moments I wish I could go back to, times when I allowed those comments to slide. “So like… what… like what are you?” a boy once asked me. We were alone in his room, the television halfheartedly displaying an infomercial in the background. I smirked. “Are you asking what race I am?” “Uh, yeah.” The question kind of bothered me, but I didn’t want to seem rude, so I just answered. I had only known this boy for a few days, and we were barely a month into our freshman year of college. He already had a reputation with a lot of girls, and I’d done everything I could to be cool and distant when he started paying attention to me. The fact that I was basically ignoring him seemed to drive him crazy, though, and eventually I decided to give him a chance.  “Well my mom is Asian, and my dad is white,” I replied. He searched my face. “So like… what kind of Asian?” “Japanese,” I told him. He smiled. “I always thought that Japanese girls were prettier than Chinese girls.” At the time I just smiled and didn’t say anything, just let the comment slide like his other backhanded, slightly off-color compliments (“You don’t talk a lot, and you don’t talk about yourself a lot, and most girls do. I dig it, it’s cool.”) I wanted so badly to seem like I didn’t care. More than anything, I was playing a game with myself, trying to prove that I could be even more removed from the situation than he was. Adjusting to college was a crazy and difficult time for me, and I just wanted to be in a situation where I knew the rules and how to play by them. So I didn’t say anything. I wish I could go back to that moment and call him out on what he said—it’s a horrible and objectifying generalization to call one race more attractive than another. The temporary validation I received immediately gave way to more self-doubt after I left that night. Asian women are often fetishized, and his comments offended me. What I had done by letting it slide wasn’t keeping my cool, it was being passive to something too important to ignore. I was wish fulfillment, playing into a role that I should have known better than to allow. Acting indifferent to his comments didn’t make a statement at all, and I realized that standing up for myself was really the stronger, if more difficult, thing to do. My identity means nothing if I just let people walk all over it. There is certainly a lot more to the issue, but at a basic level, it’s important to remember that race doesn’t always relate to appearance, and that neither of those things influence personality traits. I don’t care if someone thinks I don’t “look” or “act” Japanese or white—I am half Japanese and half white, I have always been half Japanese and half white, and I will always be half Japanese and half white no matter what I look like or how I act. I’m still learning what that means to me, and I’m still learning how to present that to the world—but maybe it shouldn’t be that complicated.", "score"=>165.69888, "summaryTitle"=>"I'm Not White, But Nobody Can Ever Tell What Race I Am", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"I have to go through a “coming out” moment in every new relationship to explain my ethnicity.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.xojane.com/issues/racial-misidentification", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1npvtss", "lastseen"=>"20140726004310", "page"=>"http://www.xojane.com/issues/racial-misidentification", "ogtitle"=>"I&#039;m Not White, But Nobody Can Ever Tell What Race I Am"}, {"domain"=>"collider.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406317244000", "h3"=>"FB Comments", "site"=>"collider.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004547", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335547375", "title"=>"Doctor Strange: Joaquin Phoenix Reportedly in Talks to Star", "initial"=>"20140725194044", "summaryText"=>"Move over Benedict Cumberbatch and those persistent rumors.  Marvel and director  Scott Derrickson might have found their   Doctor Strange .   Joaquin Phoenix is reportedly in talks to star in the titular role for Marvel’s potential new franchise.

Citizen reporters tell AM980 they saw OPP cruisers escorting ambulances northbound on Wellington Rd. towards the London Health Sciences Centre. Further information about the identities of the victims has not been released by London Police. The Costco is currently closed to the public and police have blocked the entrance off of Wellington Rd.

The web designer from Blacksburg, VA, shocks most people when he tells them that he swims with sharks. But after many thrilling dives and hundreds of up-close and personal photographs, he hopes others will see these mysterious underwater giants in a whole new light. After George’s girlfriend broke up with him in 2006, he decided to take the money he had saved for an engagement ring and go on an adventure. On his bucket list? Dive with Great White Sharks. George’s research took him to Isla Guadalupe, an island located off the coast of Baja California known for its Great White Shark sightings. He bought a point-and-shoot camera with waterproof housing, convinced his brother to join him on the trip, and set out to document a trip of a lifetime. George Probst Lovely Lucy When George prepared to embark on his first dive, he had the same “Jaws mentality” that he says many people share — an idea of a Great White Shark that wreaks havoc and attacks unknowing swimmers. But when he got into the water for the first time and found himself face-to-face with a Great White Shark, his perception changed. Underwater, George didn’t see a violent, threatening killer. He saw a beautiful, graceful creature gliding through its natural habitat. “When they come by looking you in the eye, there’s this connection,” George explains. “You just get this completely different understanding, and there’s a level of respect and awe of this huge animal.” George Probst Got my eye on you After his first dive, George was hooked. He upgraded to a DSLR and began planning more dives. He still feels the rush of that first experience every time he gets in the water. “There’s a sense of grace that you really pick up on when you’re down there,” he says. Through his photos, George hopes to present sharks as animals that have a vital role in the marine ecosystem and educate others about the importance of conservation. George Probst Great White Shark Photo “You’ve got tens of millions of these animals being taken from the oceans each year through indiscriminate killing,” George says. “And I’d like them to be around for generations to come so that other people can appreciate these beautiful animals.” Visit George’s photostream to see more of his photography.

Howard is an event promoter and a motivational speaker who teaches high school students how to write and perform poetry. Despite his many contributions to the community, Howard has had multiple run ins with police where he has been threatened, and physically assaulted. Recently, after one encounter where he was assaulted by police and beat with a billy club, he decided to file a lawsuit against the police department. Nate Howard has given a number of inspirational speeches, including one presentation that was sponsored by TED, the world renowned organization which publicizes thinkers with new and different ideas. It is important to mention that TED has been criticized in the past for censoring certain points of view, specifically in regards to the presentations of Graham Hancock and Rupert Sheldrake, but that is another topic for another day. To be booked for an event like TED is still an impressive accomplishment, and it seems a bit ridiculous that the police would treat this man like a hoodlum. See Nate Howard’s TED talk presentation “Secret to Change” below : In May, Howard gave a commencement speech at San Jose State University and hosted a celebration at a venue on the corner of East San Salvador and South First Street, In San Jose. By all accounts, the gathering was a peaceful one, where a number of African American college students where enjoying themselves and celebrating some of their college achievements. Police approached the venue where Howard was hosting his event late in the night on May 24th, and began to harass a number of his patrons. There has been no indication that the police had any actual reason to stop through the venue, and there has been no reports of police being called to the scene. It is likely that they just got the word that a party with young people was taking place, so they decided to go in and see if they could get any drug or alcohol arrests. When Howard approached the police to ask what the problem was they responded with hostility, hitting him with a baton and throwing him to the ground. Howard was then immediately placed into handcuffs and taken into custody, even though he was not charged with any crimes and video evidence clearly shows that he was no threat to the officers. Howard believes that him and his patrons were victims of racial profiling and police brutality, and he has since filed a lawsuit against the department. Joanna Cuevas Ingram from Lawyers Committee For Civil Rights told ABC News that , “ Excessive force was implemented. It was unwarranted because he posed no danger, no threat to public safety. ” Independent police auditor Judge LaDoris Cordell said that, “ We determine if their investigation was thorough, fair and objective. If their analysis was objective. If we disagree with how they’ve handled it, if we think they’re too biased in favor of officers, we send it back.” Howard said that his lawsuit is not about money, it is about the principle of the matter. Howard does not want to be a victim of this sort of harassment and brutality again, and he does not want to see his neighbors subject to these conditions either. In a Skype interview with ABC News 7 Howard said that, “I’m more motivated to try to come to an understanding of how the police enforcement is conducting their arrests.”   John Vibes is an author, researcher and investigative journalist who takes a special interest in the counter culture and the drug war.

Dan Pfeiffer, one of Obama's longest-serving advisers, told reporters that the executive actions Obama will approve at the end of the summer aimed at tackling illegal immigration will likely generate ire from Republicans who have blocked comprehensive immigration legislation. Republicans in the House of Representatives are expected next week to authorize a lawsuit against Obama on charges he has overstepped his constitutional authority by signing a series of executive orders this year on issues such as raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers. Pfeiffer, speaking at a reporters' breakfast organized by the Christian Science Monitor, said he could easily see Republicans moving to impeachment proceedings to try to remove Obama from power in retaliation for the immigration orders he is expected to unveil by the end of the summer. \"The president acting on immigration reform will certainly up the likelihood that they would contemplate impeachment,\" he said. He said it would be \"foolish to discount the possibility\" that Republicans will at least consider it. Many Republicans, however, see the Republicans' plans for a lawsuit to be aimed at restraining conservatives from seeking Obama's impeachment, knowing a move that strong could backfire as the party seeks to take over the Senate in November congressional elections. A lawsuit would have far less impact than impeachment because it would be a legal proceeding in federal court to get a ruling on whether Obama went farther than the Constitution allows. Impeachment would be aimed at removing him from office, a far more dramatic course of action that is rarely used. Obama contends his use of executive orders is no different than the powers used by his predecessors, and is inherently legal. His use of them has been relatively restrained compared with other presidents. Obama signed 147 in his first term, compared with George W. Bush's 173, Bill Clinton's 200 and Ronald Reagan's 213 for their first terms in office. TRYING TO STEP FLOW OF CHILDREN Beyond his goal of trying to making changes to U.S. immigration policy, Obama is struggling to contain a crisis on the Texas border with Mexico where tens of thousands of children have surged across in recent months, overwhelming border resources. Obama is to meet the presidents of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador on Friday afternoon seeking their help in stemming the wave of border crossers, most of whom have traveled from those three countries. Honduran President Juan Hernandez said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers' inability to reach an agreement on immigration policy was at least partly to blame for the crisis. U.S. officials blame misinformation spread by human smugglers who have told parents their children will be given safe haven in the United States if they send them there. A senior White House official said Obama would seek the leaders' help in countering that message with one that the children more than likely will be sent back home. Part of an emergency $3.7 billion border funding request from the Obama administration, about $300 million, would be allocated toward helping the countries create more favorable conditions at home so people are not tempted to leave. But there has been little apparent progress yet in Congress toward a border funding bill that Democrats and Republicans could agree upon.

We offer our utmost condolences to his family.” Hashem served as the coordinator of DCI-Palestine’s community mobilization unit, promoting constructive child participation throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory. His most recent work focused on Palestinian teens monitoring and documenting child rights violations in Hebron. He is survived by his wife Samira, his son Ayham, 11, and his two daughters, Siba, 6, and Majdal, 13. Others have been killed and injured over the last 24 hours, as people across the West Bank marched to show their solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, where over 800 civilians have died in the past three weeks. In what has been called the ‘largest West Bank demonstration in decades,’ thousands of Palestinians marched from Ramallah toward Jerusalem on Thursday night. Clashes broke out at Qalandia checkpoint, which separates Ramallah and Jerusalem, with Israeli forces opening fire on demonstrators. Soldiers shot dead a 17-year-old and injured a further 287 Palestinians. Palestinian children and civilians across the Occupied Palestinian Territory are frequently injured by the Israeli military's use of excessive force, including both crowd control weapons and live ammunition. The Israeli military’s own regulations dictate that live ammunition must be used “only under circumstances of real mortal danger,” but the regulations are not enforced and frequently ignored by Israeli soldiers, according to research by DCI-Palestine and a recent report by B’Tselem , an Israeli human rights group. For DCI-Palestine staff members, the devastating loss of Hashem intensifies our efforts to challenge the impunity and injustice that allows Israeli forces to wield disproportionate and lethal force against Palestinian civilians.", "score"=>165.44092, "summaryTitle"=>"DCI-Palestine mourns the loss of Hashem Abu Maria, colleague and friend, killed by Israeli forces | Defence for Children International Palestine", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://dci-palestine.org/documents/dci-palestine-mourns-loss-hashem-abu-maria-colleague-and-friend-killed-israeli-forces", "referrer"=>["iconfactory.com", "twittergadget.com", "direct", "t.co", "twitterrific.com", "bit.ly", "facebook.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1pkP49A", "lastseen"=>"20140726004704", "page"=>"http://dci-palestine.org/documents/dci-palestine-mourns-loss-hashem-abu-maria-colleague-and-friend-killed-israeli-forces"}, {"domain"=>"gistwing.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406329474000", "h3"=>["You may also like...", "Actress Clarion Chukwurah clocks 50 today", "Who knew Nigerian Actress Ini Edo has such hot legs and slim figure?", "Sleeping for more than 7 hours is bad for your health -Expert warns"], "site"=>"www.gistwing.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004525", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335525587", "title"=>"So this is how the lady gangstas gets down in their room.. -

The Baltimore band performed a medley of songs including their own hit “Dear Maria, Count Me In”; Yellowcard 's “Lights And Sounds” with Ryan Key and Sean Mackin; and New Found Glory's \"All Downhill From Here” with New Found Glory ’s Jordan Pundik and Chad Gilbert. They closed it with their Song Of The Year track, “A Love Like War,” featuring Pierce The Veil ’s Vic Fuentes. The band took home two Skullys that night for Song Of The Year and the Artist Philanthropic Award. We caught up with frontman Alex Gaskarth to discuss the band’s performance and how they’ll top it at next year’s APMAs . Photo Credit: Graham Fielder What was your favorite part of the night? I have to go with our performance; that was such a blast. Fifteen-year-old me was freaking out inside. I think if anyone had told me in high school that one day I’d be playing at an award show with Yellowcard and New Found Glory, I don’t think I would have believed that. Did you guys get a chance to rehearse it all together beforehand? We didn’t rehearse all together until that morning. I had come up with a loose plan of what we were going to do, and on Sunday, the four of us went over it ourselves, just to make sure we had it down and it was sounding right. Then Monday morning the other guys from the bands came in, and we ran through it all together. It definitely felt like the chemistry was there right away.   Was there a different vibe playing at the APMAs compared to playing a regular show? Yeah, just the excitement. There was a lot of hype; there was a lot of build-up. It was kind of nerve-racking. There were a lot of great performers and a lot of legendary artists there. You don’t want to go up and blow it in front of Joan Jett. [ Laughs. ] I think we really brought the energy; I think that was really the key of our performance: going out there and showing everybody what bands like ours, Yellowcard, New Found  Glory and Pierce The Veil are all about. There were a lot of big names there Monday. Was there anyone you were starstruck by? It’s pretty amazing to see people like Joan Jett and Billy Corgan who are massively influential in music. It was very cool to see them hanging out. I think it’s really cool for those [different] generations of bands to come together like that. It’s rare that that sort of thing happens. Were you surprised that nine months in, people are still reacting so positively to “Love Like War?” Yeah, I mean, that song has been really special to us. It gave our record a fresh set of legs to keep running. The song itself has done really good things for us over a long period of time. In this day and age, where it feels like songs are just a flash in the pan because there’s such an overload of information in music all the time, it’s cool when you find one that has longevity like that. How do you guys top your APMAs performance? That’s a tough one. I feel like we’re gonna need a year to come up with it. Maybe we get a floating stage, and we come in on a speedboat performing. That’s what you guys need to do next year: You need to float the stage in the harbor. If you figure out a way to float it, and then every time someone gets an award, they have to jump in the water. I’ll submit that to our marketing team, and I’ll let you know. [ Laughs. ] You gotta let me plan this thing. It’s gonna be great.  Tags pierce the veil all time low apmas new found glory yellowcard joan jett Comments", "score"=>165.37643, "summaryTitle"=>"“You don’t want to blow it in front of Joan Jett”–All Time Low’s Alex Gaskarth on the APMAs", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Alex Gaskarth thinks we should just let him plan next year&#039;s APMAs.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/all_time_low_apmas_alex_gaskarth_apmas_interview", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "alltimelow.com", "t.co", "direct", "alltimelowhustlers.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1nDu7d0", "lastseen"=>"20140726004441", "page"=>"http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/all_time_low_apmas_alex_gaskarth_apmas_interview"}, {"domain"=>"whas11.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406329421000", "h2"=>"News", "h3"=>["Grimes stays on message at Wendell Ford dinner add to reading list  ", "Archdiocese: No confirmation of Philly papal visit add to reading list  ", "BREAKING: Truck, motorcycle accident closes lane on I-64 east add to reading list  ", "Inside the furious, close-range gun battle at Pennsylvania Hospital add to reading list", "Teens run away from foster care, allegedly exchange sex for ride add to reading list  ", "JCPS releases school supply lists to principals add to reading list  ", "UofL silos to be torn down by beginning of August add to reading list  ", "No charges filed in officer-involved accident on US-42 add to reading list  ", "Amazon worker piloted drone around Space Needle add to reading list  ", "Grimes stays on message at Wendell Ford dinner add to reading list  ", "Archdiocese: No confirmation of Philly papal visit add to reading list  ", "BREAKING: Truck, motorcycle accident closes lane on I-64 east add to reading list  ", "Inside the furious, close-range gun battle at Pennsylvania Hospital add to reading list"], "site"=>"www.whas11.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004557", "keywords"=>"ride, teens, run, away, foster, care, child, place, whas", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335557677", "title"=>"Teens run away from foster care, allegedly exchange sex for ride | WHAS11.com Louisville", "initial"=>"20140725230341", "summaryText"=>"Louisville, Ky.

They were found and returned to Child Place, the center where they'd been staying. The Child Place, according to their website, works in adoption and counseling. Deputies served a warrant for Purcell's arrest a his Jeffersonville home on July 25. He turned himself into to jail this morning. His mother-in-law said she had no idea. “I think they go the wrong person,” she said. The 49-year-old is not acused of forcing the teens to have sex.

Druckmann made the announcement alongside Sam Raimi, who is set to produce the big-screen version of the PS3 horror hit. “I won’t be directing the movie but I’ll be all over it,” Raimi said. Druckmann too will have a large degree of creative control, not least writing the screenplay.  Released in 2013, the game is set in a zombie-ravaged US, which the young Ellie attempts to navigate with the aid of fellow survivalist Joel. “It’s a great character story, a great love story,” said Raimi, who refuted suggestions that it was ‘too soon’ to bring the game to the big screen. “If it was anything else I would say it is too soon, but I have faith in this [adaptation] being great.” Raimi also revealed that he is working on an Evil Dead TV show with several long-term collaborators. “I always loved working on [the Evil Dead movies] with Bruce Campbell and Rob Tapert, and my brother [Ted] and I are writing the Evil Dead TV show right now – with Bruce Campbell!”    Will you be first in line for The Last Of Us ?

But wait…what does swipe-stopping mean? Whether you’re reading this article on your mobile or computer, you most likely have the option to “swipe” through what you’re viewing. When what you view is visually stunning, you “stop swiping” through your feed to start looking at whatever image caught your eye. You’ll either slow down your swipe, or stop scrolling entirely to view the photo in more detail. This is what “swipe stopping” means. So, here’s some ways to start showing more scintillating visuals on social. 1. Put your customer’s imagination in the driver’s seat The best visuals often leave things open to interpretation, and especially the imagination. German automobile manufacturer Audi leaves the door completely open to their customers’ imagination. They then visually put their customers in the driver’s seat with almost every image they choose. This brand believes that their customers have the “courage to reimagine what’s possible.” And they embody this belief through their use of emotional images that spruce up the spirit, and allow their customers to showcase their truth. They do so in a simple way with images that don’t even show a car . The simplicity of the Audi keychain, shown close-up with a beautiful landscape in the background, allows the mind to roam. The image gives you the idea to enjoy the beautiful landscape from a car (preferably in an Audi convertible). But it relies on your imagination to fill in the details, and speed off into the sunset whichever way you choose. 2. Pinterest & Instagram: Show your visual journey Instagram and Pinterest are two of the most fun platforms to show your journey on social. They’re entirely different in terms of how you use images. So if you only have time to manage a social presence on one visual site, choose wisely. Here are some tips: a. Use Instagram to share personal photos about you and what your company does. Since each image is typically taken from your own camera phone, it shows the human side of your brand more than any other platform. Of course, you have the option to ReGram other people’s photos or post quotes. But the best images on Instagram usually come from you. b. With so much clutter on the Internet, don’t share every stream of thought that runs through your camera phone lens. Stick to a theme so that you can convey the best tone and style. Use discretion with what’s appropriate to share, so that you can (literally and figuratively) showcase your unique perspective, and share your vision in a clear, concise way. c. While the quality of the images on your iPhone is perfect for viewing on Instagram, Pinterest images tend to get pumped up a notch. For this reason, the images on Pinterest are not always as personal as Instagram, since many business owners don’t take time to professionally capture their products in a visually stunning way. (And many of the best brands on Pinterest rarely pin their own products, anyway). The good news is that you can find many images that already exist on Pinterest to showcase your pin-worthy perspective. Create mood-boards of inspiration for your customers by pinning stunning images that you come across online. 3. Play nicely with other platforms For powerful engagement in an aesthetically pleasing way, you’ll want to play nicely with other platforms. But be particularly careful which platforms you put together. For example, automatically sharing every tweet to your Facebook is not recommended. Perfect your approach with these tips: a. Even though Twitter is considered more of a text-based platform, you can combine it with Instagram to tell your story in tweets. The website If This, Then That (ifttt.com) allows you to create a recipe that tweets your images anytime you post on Instagram. Once you create the recipe, it will automatically tweet each picture. This has the added benefit of making you a bit more mindful of the images that you choose to share, since they’ll also show up in your Twitter stream. b. Choosing the perfect image for each post is part of any good content strategy. One way to do this is to use the right words when searching for stock images. Choose words that are more open-minded and general instead of getting too specific. Sometimes the most appropriate image will often appear when you search for the larger theme within what you want to depict. For example, if you’re looking for a beautiful sunset image, try searching for “nature” or “imagination” or “beauty” instead of the obvious search term of “sunset.” c. Use the Pinterest “Pin It” button to allow your visitors to pin the images in your article. Since your images will already be “swipe-stopping,” your viewers will naturally want to make their Pinterest page pretty with your Pins. This “Pin It” button is the most painless way to generate organic engagement for your images. 4. Show your silly side Fuse the various elements of your products and services by showcasing the silly, lighter side of your brand. This can help attract the best kinds of customers: serious ones who don’t take themselves so seriously. For example, General Electric’s “Hey Girl” board has the subtitle, “Thomas Edison has a crush on you.” The idiosyncratic images pinned to this board reveal that the brand keeps up with Internet memes. GE shows that even something as seemingly mundane as electronics can still spark entertainment. Showcasing your scintillating, swipe-stopping images on social media is pretty simple: Use imagination, show your journey, and play nicely. And don’t forget to top it off with a side of silly throughout the process.

The accident happened on the bay side of the bridge. The boat’s forward sail came in contact with the bridge just minutes before the bridge was scheduled to rise at 6:30 p.m. Traffic crossed the bridge while the towing effort was underway, officials said. “It was waiting for the lift when we went under,” said Petty Officer Harry Quinlan, who was among the crew aboard a smaller Coast Guard vessel. “It drifted into the bridge. It was out — the good Samaritan yanked him off the bridge — as we got back to the scene about eight minutes later.” Lift Bridge operator Scott Hill believed the wind currents were to blame. “They got too close and the wind current probably pulled them in,” Hill said. Hill said people can check the wind current indicator lights at the very top of the north tower. The red light indicates an inbound current of ¾ to 1½ knots (nautical miles per hour); the amber light means it is neutral and the green current indicates an outbound current of ¾ to 1½ knots.", "score"=>165.26389, "summaryTitle"=>"Sailboat catches on Aerial Lift Bridge", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>"us-mn-duluth", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/sailboat-catches-aerial-lift-bridge", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1o0SFbH", "lastseen"=>"20140726004317", "page"=>"http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/content/sailboat-catches-aerial-lift-bridge", "ogtitle"=>"Sailboat catches on Aerial Lift Bridge"}, {"domain"=>"wildstar-online.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406293667000", "h2"=>"Discover the Legendary Planet Nexus", "h3"=>["Get Connected", "Twitter", "WildStar is heading to gamescom!", "Listen Up, Ya'll!

Nicki Minaj subliminally posed the question last night, hours after she released her new ‘Anaconda’ single cover which featured her posing in a sports bra and g-string with an eyeful of ASSets on display. The reaction to the photo varied. Some fans praised the photo and Nicki for looking so hot, while others criticized her stripper-ish pose, and felt that the photo was too raunchy for someone of her status. The negative reactions ranged from ‘Desperate…you’re an artist, not a stripper” to “ ” An editor over at The Guardian also asked if the photo was too racy and if it undermined her image as powerful and independent: The question is whether this is a step too far, even for an artist who has always openly courted controversy. [...] Minaj doesn’t shy from ruffling her audience’s feathers. But does it undermine her image as a powerful, independently minded artist to splay her almost-bare butt cheeks in a promotional image? Or is the joke on the voyeurs who only ogle at her voluptuous body and miss the message of her lyrics? Last night, Nicki decided to snap back at her critics by posting up a number of photos of supermodels who have posed in thongs and booty-baring bikinis to her account while labeling them ‘Acceptable.’ She then reposted her own image and marked it ‘Unacceptable.’ Take a look below:   A fan of Nicki’s also posted this photo in an effort It’s hard to tell if the negative reactions to Nicki’s photo are a racial double standard, or if it has more to do with Nicki Minaj’s success. [It could be a combination of both.] She’s still a huge star and has a ton of young fans who idolize her so there is that responsibility of being a role model. When she first hit the scene, she famously posed in a squatting position for her Beam Me Up Scotty promo, however, as time went on, she changed her image from ‘sexy vixen’ to one that was more crossover and pop-friendly. She also stated in numerous interviews that she wanted people to focus on her talent and not her body. With everything that she’s been able to accomplish (Pepsi endorsement deals, stint on American Idol, Award-winning perfumes, etc) without taking off her clothes, it does seem as though the cover art is taking a few steps back, however, she’s also in a space where she feels as though she’s proven herself and she can do whatever the hell she wants now. A commenter on Facebook made an interesting observation:   Which poses the question of whether selling records in Hip Hop require the women to be sexually appealing and explicit? Here’s a few more reactions from Twitter and Facebook:   Do you agree that the negative reactions to Nicki Minaj’s photo is the result of a racial double standard? If another artist such as Katy Perry or Lady Gaga were to do the same pose, would it have received the same backlash?   ( Article Source ) Join Our Weekly Or Daily Newsletters!

Start saving for retirement early - I graduated from college at age 19 and started working", "content"=>"﻿ By Mike Timmermann, Contributor ClarkHoward.com Like many people nearing the big 3-0, I’ve spent some time thinking (obsessing) about where I am in my life and what I want to accomplish going forward. Many of those thoughts have centered on my personal life, however I’ve also reflected on my financial life. On my personal website , I document how I paid off my mortgage in 2 years at age 27. It’s something I’m very proud of, but I don’t think it would have been possible had I not laid the groundwork early on. Here now are 13 things I discovered about money in my 20s 1. Education doesn't have to break the bank - I graduated from college without any student loan debt by attending a community college, followed by a state school. Total cost? $10,000. I have a bachelor's degree just like all of my friends, but thankfully I’m not still paying for it. Graduating with zero debt helped me jumpstart my savings as soon as I landed my first career job. 2. Credit cards aren't always a bad thing - I've had credit cards since I started working at age 16. It only took one late payment fee early on to set me straight. Since then, I've paid off my balance every month without a problem. I've also redeemed credit card rewards for thousands of dollars in cash, gift cards, and travel expenses.    3. Life is easy without a mortgage - I paid off my mortgage in 2 years at age 27. It was only possible because I bought a home with an original monthly payment that looked more like a car payment! That meant sacrificing square footage in order to live the lifestyle I wanted to. 4. It doesn't matter what other people think - I spent the first few years of my 20s buying “stuff” to fit in with people who I thought were my friends. This is no way to live. Now, I don't worry about not having the latest car, clothing, or gadgets. True friends will like you for who you are. 5. Recognizing wants vs. needs - Before I go shopping, I ask myself whether the purchase is a want or a need. If it's a need, I buy it without hesitation. If it's a want, I ask myself if the purchase will make me happy before going any further. 6. Negotiating pays off - When I feel like I'm not getting a good deal on TV, phone or internet service, I pick up the phone and ask for a lower rate. I've learned that it's best to have a competing offer in hand to get the best value. Most importantly, I've always been willing to walk away if the negotiating isn’t working out. 7. Budgeting is beneficial - This is the most effective way to make sure I'm not spending more than I'm earning. I use Mint.com to track my expenses. It also sends alerts to my smartphone if I go over my budget. Knowledge is power. 8. Eating out is dangerous - Food and dining is the most difficult budget category for me to manage on a month-to-month basis. Eating out is definitely a luxury, though I’ve found a balance between cooking at home and going to restaurants. My general rule is that I will only eat out when there’s an opportunity to make memories with family and friends—no solo dining. ( Editor's note: See 8 Ways To Save While Dining Out ) 9. Comparison shopping is worth the effort - This is where watching The Price is Right has paid off. I've learned over the years what things should cost, so I never pay more than I have to at retail stores. When I'm not 100% sure of a price, I can usually find the answer with a quick Google search. 10. Start saving for retirement early - I graduated from college at age 19 and started working full-time a few months later. Unfortunately, I didn't start saving for retirement until I was 24. I used the excuse that I wasn't making enough money, however looking back I know that I could have found at least 5% to contribute to a 401(k) . 11. Manage your career wisely - I've held several positions in the decade since graduating from college. I've always worked hard to master my job and the jobs of those around me, which has led to several promotions. As far as moving on, I usually look for new opportunities when I realize there’s no more room for growth. 12. Side hustles make a difference - I’ve managed to supplement my full-time salary by working overtime, waiting tables, and picking up odd jobs, like pet sitting. Working just a few extra hours per week has provided me with thousands of dollars per year to spend on travel and entertainment—guilt-free. 13. Leasing a car isn't usually a good idea - I've owned 4 cars since I started driving at age 16. That's more than I'd like to admit, especially since I don’t drive all that much. I've also had one lease. The dealer talked me into it because it had a complimentary service package. However, the problem with a lease is getting out of it. Once you've signed on the dotted line, you may be stuck . I will never do that again. What lessons did you learn about money in your 20s? Share them in the comments section below.

The new draft Form 1040 shows a new surtax line has been created for the payment of the individual mandate surtax – see line 61 of the 1040: President Obama has repeatedly denied that the surtax is in fact actually a tax. The most prominent example was a heated exchange on ABC’s This Week in Sept. 2009, when George Stephanopoulos confronted Obama with a dictionary: STEPHANOPOULOS: I -- I don't think I'm making it up. Merriam Webster's Dictionary: Tax -- \"a charge, usually of money, imposed by authority on persons or property for public purposes.\" OBAMA: George, the fact that you looked up Merriam's Dictionary, the definition of tax increase, indicates to me that you're stretching a little bit right now. Otherwise, you wouldn't have gone to the dictionary to check on the definition. I mean what... STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, no, but... OBAMA: ... what you're saying is... STEPHANOPOULOS: I wanted to check for myself. But your critics say it is a tax increase. OBAMA: My critics say everything is a tax increase. My critics say that I'm taking over every sector of the economy. You know that. Look, we can have a legitimate debate about whether or not we're going to have an individual mandate or not, but... STEPHANOPOULOS: But you reject that it's a tax increase? OBAMA: I absolutely reject that notion.  [ Transcript ]     It was always obvious that the penalty for not complying with Obamacare’s individual mandate was just another surtax: The surtax is collected by, and enforced by, the IRS. As shown by the newly released draft Form 1040, the surtax is paid as part of normal income tax filing by taxpayers. The individual mandate surtax was written into tax law itself by the Obamacare statute. Revenues derived from the individual mandate surtax have always been scored by the Congressional Budget Office as tax revenue.   Famously, Chief Justice John Roberts pointed out that the individual mandate surtax is in fact a tax. However, that does not compel conservatives to agree that Obamacare’s individual mandate is Constitutional. The same decision declared the individual mandate unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. Conservatives can accept that this surtax is a tax increase without accepting the constitutionality of the individual mandate. The Obamacare individual mandate non-compliance surtax is one of at least seven Obamacare taxes that violate the President’s “firm pledge” not to raise any tax on any American making less than $250,000 per year.

Zimmer however, was unaware of any reason why Cordarrelle would be interested in chatting. Arriving to Mankato on Thursday, Patterson was seen walking with a slight limp that continued on the sidelines through Friday afternoon as well. Early reports are that CP has a strained foot and was being held out of practice today as a precaution. Speculating further, Zimmer confirmed there was one player on the team's 90-man roster who did not pass Thursday afternoon's conditioning test.

Although obviously the summer transfer market is all about football, when it comes to some of the game's biggest stars--such as Cristiano Ronaldo--anything involving them makes the news, whether it directly relates to things happening on the pitch. According to American site TMZ , rapper Dwayne Carter, Jr., known worldwide to his legions of fans as Lil Wayne, has opted to expand his already massive empire by making a move into the sports industry. And what better way to do so than to sign the Real Madrid star as he looks to break ground on his new sports management company, with this year's Ballon d'Or winner already being ranked as among the most marketable athletes on the planet. No, he's not teaming up with the Portuguese star on a rap label or anything.

The president rails against a problem of his own making , in this case corporate ‘inversions’ that would be a lot less likely if he had brought both parties together to fix our outdated tax code.  Then he comes out with a plan that would actually make the problem worse .  As the Ways & Means Committee notes : “In a typical inversion, an American company becomes a foreign company only on paper to pay lower taxes, but the headquarters and employees remain in the United States.  The President’s plan creates a perverse incentive to not just move on paper, but to actually move the headquarters and jobs overseas.   That’s because the legislation does not allow the company to get the tax benefit if it is managed and controlled in the US. That’s a lose-lose proposition for American workers. ” Exactly.  At a time when our economy is sputtering, the president’s plan  would just send more jobs overseas.   That doesn’t sound very patriotic, now does it? How about we instead just do what needs to be done, and we fix our tax code from top to bottom?  How about we clear out the clutter of tax loopholes and lower rates for everyone?  Then we can really keep jobs and resources here.  Republicans remain ready to do this as part of our focus on jobs .  But it isn’t really about solving the problem, is it? After all, the president huffs and puffs about wanting Congress to act NOW, but one top Senate Democrat “ readily admits that lawmakers are not likely to act anytime soon. ”   Some Senate Democrats won’t even back the plan .  So what could this be about?  Could it be the president attempting to stave off political trouble instead of addressing the people’s priorities? “Obama’s move seems entirely political ” ( POLITICO ) “The president was clearly in campaign mode ” ( CBS News ) “There’s a heavy political tinge … to Obama’s plea” ( The Christian Science Monitor ) That’s funny, since the very notion of patriotism is about putting country above party and bringing people together for the greater good.     Instead of dividing people for political advantage, the president can endorse our push for comprehensive tax reform or convince Senate Democrats to act.  Let’s solve the real problem here.  Otherwise, every pink slip from companies moving overseas may as well be signed, ‘President Barack H. Obama.’", "score"=>164.95363, "summaryTitle"=>"When Opportunism Is Disguised as ‘Patriotism’", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.speaker.gov/general/when-opportunism-disguised-patriotism", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "direct", "speaker.gov", "twittergadget.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1riC2Mx", "lastseen"=>"20140726004209", "page"=>"http://www.speaker.gov/general/when-opportunism-disguised-patriotism", "ogtitle"=>"Speaker.gov | When Opportunism Is Disguised as ‘Patriotism’"}, {"domain"=>"politico.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406287385000", "h3"=>["Text Size", "Authors:", "Read more about:", "Short URL:", "Send to a friend VA reform hits stalemate", "POLITICO Video", "POLITICO Magazine", "POLITICO Presents", "Popular on POLITICO", "POLITICO Blogs", "Recommended on Facebook", "Wuerking Drawings"], "site"=>"www.politico.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726003024", "keywords"=>"Department Of Veterans Affairs,Politics,House Republicans,Senate Democrats, Burgess Everett and Lauren French", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406334624462", "title"=>"VA reform hits stalemate - Burgess Everett and Lauren French - POLITICO.com", "initial"=>"20140725112305", "summaryText"=>"When revelations surfaced earlier this summer that the Department of Veterans Affairs provided poor health care to veterans — leading to some deaths — a genuine scandal erupted and Congress promised to impose big changes.

In fact, Democrats and Republicans agree on the core outlines of the bill. Instead, Congress is in the middle of another standoff over money. ( Also on POLITICO: Path to child migrant compromise? ) Democrats and Republicans are struggling to agree on how to pay for legislation that could cost between $25 billion and $30 billion. That logjam is transforming the VA debate from one that united both parties to yet another fiscal fight, prompting the same type of partisan finger pointing that has become familiar after years of budget showdowns. “They have walked away from it,” Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said of House Republicans. “It’s unfortunate, because we had a strong bipartisan vote, and that doesn’t mean much to the House.” Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said it was “shameful” that Senate Democrats refused to negotiate with the House. He was referring to a decision by Senate Democrats to boycott a hastily called meeting Thursday of the House-Senate conference committee charged with finalizing a bill. “Senate Democrats refused to even show up and discuss bipartisan solutions, preferring instead to talk behind closed doors. That is shameful,” the Ohio Republican said. ( Also on POLITICO: McCain: Ariz. execution 'torture' ) And despite optimism from the two co-chairs of the conference committee that Congress will be able to eke out a deal, senators in both parties said the negotiations are at a standstill. “The pressure and all of this back-and-forth is because we haven’t been negotiating,” said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said the talks appear to be “veering away.” Tension that had been bubbling for weeks exploded with a parade of Senate Democrats taking to the floor Thursday to blast House Republicans for suddenly calling a conference committee meeting. They said that decision was made unilaterally by House Veterans Affairs’ Chairman Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) to offer a “take-it-or-leave-it” proposal with just days left before a five-week congressional recess. Miller responded by accusing Senate Veterans’ Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) of lobbing “grenades” at him through the media. It’s a nasty fight with deep political implications: No politician wants to be seen as the roadblock to aiding veterans who were stiffed by the VA’s falsified appointment logs. Senate Democratic aides no longer believe Miller is acting in good faith; Miller accused Sanders of showboating with his refusal to attend the Thursday conference committee hearing. Despite the nasty back-and-forth, somehow both Miller and Sanders say they are optimistic the conference committee can reach a deal before next Friday. “I haven’t foreclosed on anything,” Miller said. “I have every intention of having something passed through both Houses by the time we leave. One week from today.” “I am hopeful that we can come up with an agreement,” Sanders said. “I do believe that every member of the United States Congress understands what a terrible thing it would be to turn our backs on the needs of the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us.”", "score"=>164.94565, "summaryTitle"=>"VA reform hits stalemate", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"When revelations surfaced earlier this summer that the Department of Veterans Affairs provided poor health care to veterans &mdash; leading to some deaths &mdash; a genuine scandal erupted and Congress promised to impose big changes.

The volunteers were part of what federal scientists say was the most comprehensive study", "content"=>"A small group of volunteers spent much of the last year getting drunk and stoned on marijuana furnished by the federal government before getting behind the wheel. The volunteers were part of what federal scientists say was the most comprehensive study ever conducted on how marijuana, and pot combined with alcohol, affect drivers. The data now being analyzed ultimately will help regulators decide how stoned is too stoned to drive. It's similar to the studies conducted to develop levels for drunken driving. Volunteers were recruited from around Iowa City, home to the University of Iowa's National Advanced Driving Simulator. \"They were happy to participate,\" says Dr. Marilyn Huestis, chief of chemistry and drug metabolism at the Intramural Research Program at the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The participants never got on real roads. Instead, they drove for about 40 minutes behind the wheel of NADS, a federally funded simulator that can mimic the look and feel of everything from urban parking lots to darkened gravel roads. Deer jump out unexpectedly. Passing cars swerve. Before getting behind the NADS wheel, each volunteer was required to consume specific combinations of marijuana and alcohol, or a placebo. Because the university has a smoke-free campus, the volunteers had to use a vaporizer to consume their marijuana, which was furnished under strict rules by a federal garden at the University of Mississippi. Each of the 19 drivers who completed the six combinations of pot and alcohol gave blood and saliva tests during their drives to check intoxication levels, says Huestis, who says the entire experiment took three years to design and administer. The testing finished this spring, and now scientists are studying the 250 variables checked by the tests. They hope to have initial data available by October. \"In this country, there's a huge controversy over whether there should be zero tolerance or there should be some level that's acceptable. It's a terribly difficult problem,\" Huestis says. \"We will be looking at what are the kinds of functions that are affected, and whether they are significantly different … whether alcohol is on board or not.\" Colorado State Trooper J.J. Wolff has made a career of tracking down drunken and drugged drivers. As one of the state's leading experts in identifying impaired drivers, Wolff knows many Americans are watching what's happening on Colorado roads. He says he's not yet seen a major increase in stoned drivers, but state troopers are definitely looking. \"I have personally not seen more stoned drivers, not arrested more stoned drivers,\" says Wolff, who also trains new troopers how to recognize impaired drivers. \"From my point of view, that's good.\" To check whether drivers might be impaired by alcohol, marijuana or prescription drugs, Wolff puts them through a series of voluntary roadside tests. The tests, which include standing on one leg while counting silently, and walking in a straight line, check someone's sense of time and motor skills. Marijuana, like alcohol, is a central nervous system depressant. That means it affects how someone perceives time, Wolff says. \"My first objective is to make sure you're OK to drive,\" he says. One of the most useful tools police officers have is the portable breath test, which instantly checks a driver's intoxication level through the amount of alcohol they exhale. In the past few weeks, Wolff has been testing a new kind of rapid screening system for marijuana use. The test takes about 10 minutes, using a drop of saliva from a driver. Most of the commonly used marijuana tests require a blood draw and take days to yield results. Those tests can really tell only whether someone has used marijuana in the past week or so, not whether they are impaired now. Wolff says the federal research will help by leading to specific guidelines on what's considered impaired. For alcohol, police generally say that someone with a blood-alcohol level of .08 percent is too drunk to drive. Wolff and Huestis say decades of federal research on alcohol impairment has given lawmakers and police sound science upon which to base drunken-driving laws. Marijuana hasn't been studied as carefully. Colorado has significantly boosted the number of \"drug recognition expert\" officers patrolling its roads, and other states are following suit. In Cheyenne, Wyo,, just north of the Colorado state line, all officers there have received special training to better recognize marijuana-impaired drivers. \"When it comes to cannabis, it's a lot trickier than when it comes to alcohol,\" Wolff says. \"I can't tell you if one joint is going to make you high to the point where you can't drive. That's a really hard question to answer at this point. ... \"The safest thing to do right now: If you are going to drink any amount, don't drive. And if you are going to consume any amount of cannabis, don't drive.\" Testing for impaired drivers Voluntary roadside tests like the walk-and-turn check a driver's ability to do several things at once, known as \"divided attention.\" Driving is actually pretty complicated – remember how nervous you were when you first started trying to manage the wheel, brakes, gas and turn signals? Because there's no quick chemical or breath test for marijuana available to most police officers, the standard voluntary roadside tests have taken on new importance as states increasingly legalize marijuana use. The tests administered by police officers are designed to check your ability to follow directions and track the passage of time, along with your ability to move your body properly. Marijuana and alcohol can both affect your ability to follow directions and move carefully. The tests aren't intended to \"trick\" anyone, and can easily be completed by a sober driver. In many cases, the police officer looks for subtle signs such as how much you blink, or whether your eyes bounce or cross when following the tip of a pen.", "score"=>164.91801, "summaryTitle"=>"Feds test how stoned is too stoned to drive", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"A small group of volunteers spent much of the last year getting drunk and stoned on marijuana furnished by the federal government before getting behind the wheel.", "cities"=>"us-wa", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.king5.com/news/Feds-test-how-stoned-is-too-stoned-to-drive-268645192.html", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1l1XykV", "lastseen"=>"20140726004523", "page"=>"http://www.king5.com/news/feds-test-how-stoned-is-too-stoned-to-drive-268645192.html", "ogtitle"=>"Feds test how stoned is too stoned to drive"}, {"domain"=>"wzzm13.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406326184000", "h3"=>["Threat against Citgo management following clerk's murder", "Sent!", "Posted!"], "site"=>"www.wzzm13.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004710", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335630513", "title"=>"Threat against Citgo management following clerk's murder", "initial"=>"20140725220944", "summaryText"=>"BATTLE CREEK, Mich.

Schools, housing costs, amenities, and, of course, safety all play into deciding the best place to call home. If you’re looking to move to Georgia, you might be at a loss as far as deciding where to go. Here at the Movoto Real Estate Blog, we know a little something about housing, and we also know a little something about safety. To help anyone who’s curious or needs it, we’ve compiled a list of the safest places in the Peach State. Those places are: 1. City of Johns Creek 2. City of Acworth 3. City of Canton 4. City of Kennesaw 5. City of Grovetown 6. City of Duluth 7. City of Suwanee 8. City of Dallas 9. City of Woodstock 10. City of Loganville If you’re curious where your hometown, or future hometown, ranked, you can scroll to the bottom of this article to see our full list of safe places. For now, let’s go over the criteria we used to determine if a place was safe or not. How We Created This Ranking First, we compiled a list of the biggest places in the state over 10,000 people.Then we collected crime data from the 2012 FBI Uniform Crime Report in the following categories: Murder Rape Robbery Assault Burglary Theft Vehicle theft We divided these crimes into four categories: Murders Violent crimes Property crimes Total crimes If a place did not have crime data, we omitted it, which gave us a total of 73 places. Once we had all that, we found crime rates for each place per 100,000 people in order to fairly compare big and small places against each other. Then, we ranked each place in each category from one to 73, with scores closer to one being the safest. Finally, we scored each category so that murders, violent crimes, and property crimes accounted for 30 percent of the overall score, where total crimes made up 10. We averaged these adjusted rankings into one overall Big Deal Score , where the lowest score was our safest place. Let’s take a moment with each of our top 10 places, and examine more closely why each one earned the title of safest in Georgia. 1. Johns Creek Source: Flickr user Wayan Vota Like all the places in our top 10, Johns Creek had no murders in 2012. It also only had four rapes, 20 robberies, and 30 assaults per 100,000 people. That made Johns Creek one of the least violent cities on our entire list. What pushed it over the top was that it had merely 20 vehicle thefts per 100,000 in 2012, which is astonishing for its size. Compared to Augusta, which had over 600 vehicle thefts per 100,000, it’s obvious that this spot is safe for people and property alike. 2. Acworth Source: Flickr user U.S. Department of Agriculture Acworth had no rapes or murders reported in 2012, and only 19 robberies and 33 assaults per 100,000 people. These stats make this place the second least violent city on our list. These numbers resulted in locals here only having a 1 in 49 chance of being a victim of a crime, most likely a property crime. It might not be as safe as our first place location, which offers a 1 in 141 chance, but it’s far better than other cities, like Atlanta, where residents had a 1 in 12 chance of being a victim. 3. Canton Source: Flickr user leighadactyl Canton had no murders reported in 2012, but the safety didn’t stop there. This place had the seventh lowest violent crime and the fourth lowest property crime on our list. For a small place, the 17 rapes and 30 robberies and assaults per 100,000 people may seem like quite a bit, but it’s far better than Augusta, which had 43 rapes and 114 robberies per 100,000. People living in this safe little city had only 1 one in 55 chance of being the victim of a crime. 4. Kennesaw Source: Flickr user Muora Kennesaw had no murders, three rapes, and only 29 robberies per 100,000 people. It did have 66 assaults, which is higher than the other places in our top 10, but still much better than bigger cities such as Atlanta. This place also had the third lowest property crime on our list, with only 1,635 crimes of that type occurring. These numbers all added up to Kennesaw inhabitants only having a one in 58 chance of being the victim of a crime, one of the lowest chances on our entire list. 5. Grovetown Source: Flickr user Chris Harrison Grovetown had the fourth lowest violent crime in our rankings. There was a little more property crime here, ranking 12th, but there was still very low vehicle theft here with only 94 thefts of this type per 100,000 people. And, of course, there were no murders reported in 2012. 6. Duluth Source: Flickr user GMC Auxiliary Duluth had the ninth lowest crime overall, but there was more to it than that. The seventh lowest property crime, with only 83 vehicle thefts and 290 burglaries per 100,000 people, definitely was one of the major factors in this place ranking sixth on our overall safety list. The other major factor was the no murders reported in 2012 and only four rapes per 100,000 people, which was some of the lowest on our list. Those numbers all mean that locals in Duluth have a very safe 1 in 47 chance of being the victim of a crime, with it likely being a non-violent one. 7. Suwanee Source: David Douglas Residents of Sewanee will be happy to know that they had only a 1 in 44 chance of being the victim of a crime. Besides the no murders reported in 2012, there were 25 rapes per 100,000, 44 robberies per 100,000, and 69 assaults per 100,000, for the 12th lowest violent crime overall. With only 1629 thefts and 82 vehicle thefts per 100,000 people, this place had the 10th lowest property crime on our list, and 10th lowest overall crime in our rankings. 8. Dallas Source: City of Dallas With no murders, nine rapes, 60 robberies, and 111 assaults per 100,00 people, Dallas had very low violent crime and even lower property crime, ranked 11th. This place did seem to have a fairly high number of total crimes at 2,331 per 100,000, but let’s put that in a little perspective. Columbus had a total of 6,251 crimes per 100,000 people, which included nine murders. 9. Woodstock Source: Flickr user Godverbs There were no murders in Woodstock in 20012, and the mere 170 violent crimes per 100,000 was one of the lowest rates we saw in our rankings. All of this came out to Woodstock having the 14th lowest total crime. Though having a 1 in 38 chance of being the victim of a crime doesn’t sound very low, let’s compare that to a similarly sized place, such as Griffin, which had a one in 13 chance. Factor in that Griffin also had eight murders and 29 rapes per 100,000 and you can see why Woodstock placed so much higher on our list. 10. Loganville Source: City of Loganville Loganville had no murders in 2012, nine rapes, 37 robberies, and 93 assaults per 100,000 people. That’s the 13th lowest violent crime rate on our list. It also doesn’t hurt that Loganville had the 17th lowest crime overall. The property crime here was also fairly low, ranking 18th. The vehicle theft here was higher than others in our top 10, with 177 crimes of that sort per 100,000, but that’s still honestly pretty good. Just look at Atlanta, which had 1178 vehicle thefts per 100,000 and that might put the numbers in a little perspective for you.

Meanwhile, preparations continue for the launch of another station resupply vehicle next week. Station Commander Steve Swanson kicked off the day with the Skin B study as he scanned the skin on his forearm with several dermatology tools. Skin B investigates the accelerated aging of skin that seems to occur during spaceflight. Results from this study will improve the understanding of the mechanisms of skin aging as well as provide insight into the aging process of similar body tissues. Afterward, Swanson assisted Flight Engineer Reid Wiseman with the Cardio Ox experiment, which is investigating the risks of cardiovascular disease related to long-duration spaceflight. With guidance from the ground team, Swanson performed an ultrasound scan on Wiseman and measured his blood pressure. Results from this experiment will help researchers determine if biological markers of oxidative and inflammatory stress are elevated during and after spaceflight, and how those markers correlate with the long-term health changes in astronauts. [image-78]Wiseman then prepared a new test sample for an experiment known as the Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-C1, or BCAT-C1 , and photographed the hardware from multiple angles. Results from this ongoing investigation of colloids – mixtures of small particles distributed throughout a liquid – will help materials scientists to develop new consumer products with unique properties and longer shelf lives. Inside the station’s Kibo laboratory, Flight Engineer Alexander Gerst continued configuring the Aquatic Habitat for the Zebrafish Muscle study. The Aquatic Habitat, consisting of two aquariums with a closed loop water circulation system, is capable of accommodating small freshwater fish, such as medaka or zebrafish, which serve as ideal models for vertebrates. A small school of zebrafish will soon be making a trip up to space to help scientists learn more about the basic mechanisms behind muscle loss. Swanson later joined Gerst in the Kibo lab for more tests with a trio of soccer-ball-sized robots known as the Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites, or SPHERES . The free-flying robots were equipped with stereoscopic goggles called the Visual Estimation and Relative Tracking for Inspection of Generic Objects, or VERTIGO , to enable the SPHERES to perform relative navigation based on a 3D model of a target object. Wiseman meanwhile worked out the station’s weightlifting machine -- the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device, or ARED – while he wore a pair of shoes equipped with sensors to measure the force loads. The Force Shoes study , which uses a commercially available off-the-shelf product developed by Xsens, is an engineering evaluation to see if these shoes can provide more precise insight into the loads the crew experiences on ARED. Wiseman wrapped up his workday with a checkout of the Multi-Gas Monitor by testing the ammonia and temperature sensors. On the Russian side of the complex, Flight Engineer Alexander Skvortsov continued unloading some of the 2.8 tons of cargo that arrived Wednesday evening aboard the ISS Progress 56 resupply spacecraft. Progress 56 docked to the Pirs docking compartment at 11:31 p.m. EDT Wednesday less than six hours after its launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Pirs was vacated Monday by ISS Progress 55, which is now undergoing a series of engineering tests prior to being sent to a destructive re-entry over the Pacific Ocean on July 31. › Read more about the Progress launch, docking Flight Engineer Max Suraev performed a session of the Calcium experiment, which examines the causes of the loss of bone density that occurs in weightless environment. For this study, Russian researchers are looking at the solubility of calcium phosphates and human bone samples in water in space. [image-94]The third Russian cosmonaut aboard the station, Flight Engineer Oleg Artemyev, began the day with a Crew Medical Officer proficiency training session. He later conducted an audit of the spacewalk tethers aboard the station. Artemyev then downloaded micro-accelerometer from the Identification experiment, which measures the loads on the station during dynamic events such as dockings or reboosts. He also monitored readings from the Matryoshka radiation-detection study. Artemyev rounded out his workday recharging a battery for the Cascade cell-cultivation experiment. Over the weekend, the station’s six crew members will take care of weekly housekeeping chores as they wipe down surfaces and vacuum dust. They also will continue their daily 2.5-hour workouts to stay fit and to prevent the loss of muscle mass and bone density that occurs in microgravity. Meanwhile, everything is proceeding on track for Tuesday’s launch of the European Space Agency’s fifth and final Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV-5) atop an Ariane 5 rocket from the Arianespace launch site in Kourou, French Guiana on the northern coast of South America. Dubbed the “Georges Lemaître” in honor of the Belgian physicist and astronomer, ATV-5 will launch at 7:47 p.m. Tuesday (8:47 p.m. Kourou time) to begin a two-week trek to the station to deliver seven tons of food, fuel and supplies for the Expedition 40 crew. ATV-5 is slated to dock to the aft end of the Zvezda service module on August 12 at 9:34 a.m. › Learn more about the Automated Transfer Vehicle", "score"=>164.61067, "summaryTitle"=>"Robotics, Research and Resupply Round Out Week for Station Crew", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Research and robotics rounded out a productive week Friday for the station&#039;s six-person Expedition 40 crew.", "cities"=>"null", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.nasa.gov/content/robotics-research-and-resupply-round-out-week-for-station-crew", "referrer"=>["google.co.in", "nasa.gov", "google.com", "direct", "t.co", "facebook.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/WRmJkI", "lastseen"=>"20140726004605", "page"=>"http://www.nasa.gov/content/robotics-research-and-resupply-round-out-week-for-station-crew", "ogtitle"=>"Robotics, Research and Resupply Round Out Week for Station Crew"}, {"domain"=>"denofgeek.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406320804000", "h2"=>"AMC has premiered the first full trailer for The Walking Dead seaosn 5 at San Diego Comic-Con...", "h3"=>["Main menu", "Sponsored Links", "Latest in TV", "Hot Topics", "Featured content", "Sponsored Links", "Popular"], "site"=>"www.denofgeek.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726003704", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335024341", "title"=>"First full trailer for The Walking Dead season 5 | Den of Geek", "initial"=>"20140725204004", "summaryText"=>"\"They're screwing with the wrong people\" Blimey.

Siyata Dishmaya choreographing the chain of events has prevented this from occurring. NRG correspondent Ariel Kahane, quoting senior security sources reports that 200 terrorists planned to make their way via tens of tunnels to six Western Negev communities and slaughter and kidnap the populations of those communities. The tunnels that were built by Hamas in Gaza were not random, but they were set up for a multi-pronged terrorist attack in which they planned to slaughter and abduct entire communities. This was to take place on Rosh Hashanah 5775 R”L. The attack was prevented as a result of Hamas’ continued rocket fire, followed by the terrorist leaders refusing to accept a ceasefire, thereby compelling the ground forces operation in Gaza. The terrorists planned to bring dozens of hostages to Gaza via the vast tunnel network. Had the attack taken place, hundreds of people would likely have been killed R”L and many more injured. It should be pointed out that while many are told the IDF was blind to the tunnels, this is not so and tunnels were destroyed from 2005-2008, after the Disengagement until Operation Cast Lead. Then Southern District Commander Major-General Yoav Gallant wanted to enter Gaza to address the tunnel situation but he was prevented from doing so by then Defense Minister Ehud Barak. Former IDF Major-General Yitzchak Yisrael, a noted expert on the matter told Channel 10 News on erev Shabbos that the IDF has been working for years on addressing the tunnel issue and he is optimistic that in a year to two the development of the solution will be complete. He adds the low tech matter of tunnels poses a problem to countries around the world and they date back to Vietnam and the Korean War, and the US like Israel does not have a definitive solution to this day.

Toyota FT-1 concept, 2014 Detroit Auto Show Toyota has teamed up with BMW to develop a new sports car platform that will underpin a new Supra from the Japanese automaker and a replacement for the Z4 from the German side. BMW is thought to be doing most of the development work for the platform and engines that will power the cars, in return for hybrid and fuel cell technology from Toyota . Citing an inside source at Toyota, Japanese magazine Holiday Auto (via Motoring ) claims the new Supra will feature a complex hybrid system combining a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine sourced from BMW with a trio of electric motors. In similar fashion to Acura’s new NSX , the new Supra will feature an electric motor at each of the front wheels and a third electric motor integrated with the engine and transmission. The setup was previewed in last year’s Yaris Hybrid-R concept and a beefier version is featured in Toyota’s TS040 Hybrid Le Mans prototype. Incredibly, the setup relies on a supercapacitor to store electrical energy and this is expected to feature in the new Supra. A charging port will allow owners to plug the car into an electrical outlet, making the new Supra a plug-in hybrid. Peak output of the system is expected to be more than 350 horsepower, which might not sound like much but you have to factor in that the target weight for the car is less than 3,086 pounds. Despite a previous report claiming the BMW sports car will also get the technology , it’s now thought that the new Supra will be the only recipient. This makes sense in terms of vehicle differentiation: Toyota goes the all-wheel-drive, hybrid route for the new Supra, while BMW sticks with conventional powertrains (in-line four- and six-cylinder units) and rear-wheel drive for its Z4 replacement.

The shootings occurred at the following locations: - Church and Backer - Fairmont and Holt - Griffith and Channing - Clinton and Marks - California and Fairview. Fresno police officers say those gang members have their attention. So on Friday night and this weekend, they'll be giving them special attention after the rash of shootings. Police say it all started when a 4-year-old was shot in the lower body on East Church, and detectives say that's when the child's family members became suspects. Authorities initially said the child was 3 years old . Shortly after midnight, there were four more shootings -- all connected and all believed to be gang-related. In the end, two men and the four-year-old were wounded. All of them are expected to be OK. As of now, no one has been arrested, but they did impound a car and say they're getting a little bit more cooperation from witnesses and from the people involved. And they'll be out in full force this weekend, trying to put themselves in the middle of the retaliation. \"We conduct operations on those gangs. Who's on AB 109 probation? Who's on parole? We know locations where they congregate and we go to those locations,\" said Fresno Police Lt. Mark Salazar. \"So, there's a reason why we've recovered hundreds of firearms from gang members this year.\" Salazar says ironically, minutes before the initial shooting where the 4-year-old was wounded, they were preparing to search that very same home. And police also say despite this recent rash of shootings, violent crime is actually down and there are fewer shootings this year as compared to last.

Highlights of the 13 tracks included on this compilation are: the under-the-radar cosmic disco tune “Got To Have You” by Joanne Wilson, a rare P&P Records-influenced track “Dance With Me” by Odessey One, the icy cool synth-trenched “Living On A String” by Wild Fire, the incredible dance floor-friendly “Instant Funk” by Merchant, and the disco reggae cover of “Rapper’s Delight” by Prince Blackman masterfully edited by Waxist Selecta.

Why? She wanted to challenge her own and others’ perceptions of beauty and see if her self-worth was locked inside her makeup bag. In a reflective post for the Lexington Herald-Leader , she explained how the experiment changed her life. Going from long-lashed and red-lipped at fraternity parties she showcased spots and dark shadows instead. “I felt uncomfortable, undesirable and embarrassed,” she explained, citing that fewer guys approached her at the parties, “and when they did, the short-lived conversations felt awkward”. It left her “less outgoing when meeting new people” and eventually avoiding parties altogether. Her theory is that while guys say they prefer girls without makeup on (we’ve all heard it), it’s actually idea of it they like, clueless as to how women use it to enhance their natural beauty. Living in a beauty pageant-obsessed state seeped in makeover culture, Annie rightly began to realise that “the reason life might sometimes feel like a beauty competition is because life can be a beauty competition,\" - but often it’s also a competition with yourself. While her experience was shocking her conclusions proved inspiring. After 7 month she began to care a whole lot less and began relying on her other assets more. “I've learned that some people do treat me differently, but the people who matter don't. I've also learned that I overemphasized how much thought other people gave to my appearance.” She said that having to work on her “kindness, humor and positivity” - something we’re all born with, right? - helped her “change in meaningful ways”.

Two years ago, modern infrastructure came very close to a serious disruption. The culprit? One of the largest solar storms in recorded history. Plasma exploding from the surface of the sun in a coronal mass ejection barreled through space and crossed through Earth's orbital path on July 23, 2012. If the flare had erupted about one week earlier, Earth would have been squarely in the line of fire, Daniel N. Baker wrote in a study published in the journal Space Weather. (Baker is with the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado). This is not the first time solar activity has threatened Earth. A massive solar storm in 1859, dubbed the Carrington Event after the English astronomer who witnessed it, caused the northern lights to appear as far south as Cuba; and it caused telegraph lines to spark, setting fire to a number of buildings, according to Science@NASA editor Dr. Tony Phillips. \"According to data from the STEREO-A spacecraft (a solar observatory), the solar storm of July 23, 2012, was every bit as potent as the Carrington storms,\" he said. Baker said that had our planet been in the path of the storm, it would not be inconceivable that we would still be \"picking up the pieces.\" Phillips agrees. \"As society relies more and more on high technology such as GPS, the Internet, satellite communications and smart power grids, we also expose ourselves more and more to the dangers of stormy space weather.\" He added that power outages after the storm could have persisted for many months. If the solar storm had hit, much of Earth's technology would be rendered inoperable: from radios and GPS systems to toilets. Though human beings would not be physically harmed directly, a study by the National Academy of Sciences estimates that damage from a coronal mass ejection of similar magnitude could exceed $2 trillion in the United States and pose risks to national security. While Earth did get lucky in 2012, humans should not get too comfortable. Despite the relatively mild conditions on the sun, solar storms are unpredictable. According to Baker, \"incredibly powerful\" space weather is possible at any time.", "score"=>164.22919, "summaryTitle"=>"Solar storm barely missed earth in 2012", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Two years ago, modern infrastructure came very close to a serious disruption.

This happened on July 11 at Naktinis Tbilisis club in Panevezys. The video shows the bartender mixing the drink when a flame explodes and shoots out at the man, who then catches on fire.

Blake Lively   Source Blake Lively was the star of Gossip Girl with her role as Serena van der Woodsen, a beautiful blonde from the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Blake’s character is care free, charismatic, and laid back, and is often accused of getting her way because of her charisma and good looks. Lively played Serena van der Woodsen from 2007 until 2012, when Gossip Girl came to an end. Since then, she has shared with the world that her true passion is cooking. She is launching a brand new lifestyle website in July 2014 that will have a blog with recipes, fashion-related topics, and even cooking tutorials from Lively. 2. Leighton Meester   Source Leighton Meester is another star in the series Gossip Girl. She played Blair Waldorf, a sensitive, snobby, hilarious overachiever. Her character comes off as self-centered and snobby, but deep down, beneath the insecurities, she is a good girl at heart. Meester is now married to Adam Brody, an actor from the former TV series The O.C. and they are happy together. Meester is still acting and has even ventured into the music industry as well. 3. Ed Westwick   Source Ed Westwick played the role of Chuck Bass on Gossip Girl. Chuck Bass is romantically involved with Blair Waldorf throughout the series and he is known for his financial ambition and drive. Since Gossip Girl has ended, Westwick has appeared in Romeo and Juliet, which came out in 2013. He also has several acting roles in the works, including: Last Flight, A Conspiracy on Jekyll Island, Kitchen Sink, and Bone in the Throat. We think it is safe to say that Westwick will not be done acting anytime soon. 4. Penn Dayton Badgley   Source   Penn Dayton Badgley is known for his role on Gossip Girl as Dan Humphrey. His character Dan is not considered rich like some of the other characters on the show but he dates Serena van der Woodsen. He is a poet and is a very sensitive and attractive guy on the show. Since his time on the TV series and breaking up with Blake Lively, he has had several acting roles, including Parts per Billion, Cymbeline, and The Paper Store. He is currently in a relationship with Domino Kirke, a famous English-American singer and musician. 5. Chace Crawford   Source Chace Crawford is known for playing Nate Archibald on the TV series Gossip Girl. Nate is known as the perfect boy from the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Since his time on Gossip Girl, Crawford has ventured off into playing acting roles that are a bit “darker” than his role as Nate Archibald. He wants people to see his true acting skills and what he can really do on set. He is filming Undrafted right now, along with Tyler Hoechlin and Aaron Tveit, Eloise, along with Robert Patrick and Eliza Dushki. 6. Matthew Settle   Source Matthew Settle took on the role of Rufus Humphrey on the hit TV series Gossip Girl. He is a former rock star and as the series unfolds, viewers watch his marriage fall apart and his love for his former girlfriend, Lily van der Woodsen, grow stronger. Since Gossip Girl, Settle has appeared in a few films, including: A Sister’s Nightmare and Ouija. He married actress and model Naama Nativ and they had a daughter together, named Aven. However, the couple divorced in 2011.       Sponsored Link", "score"=>164.14757, "summaryTitle"=>"Gossip Girl Cast: Where are They Now", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"The Cast of Gossip Girl, before and after, what are they doing now.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://fad-nation.com/513/gossip-girl-cast-now/", "referrer"=>["superclick.com", "t.co", "direct", "bit.ly"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1xcOP4J", "lastseen"=>"20140726004025", "page"=>"http://fad-nation.com/513/gossip-girl-cast-now/", "ogtitle"=>"Gossip Girl Cast: Where are They Now - FadNation"}, {"domain"=>"csmonitor.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406315407000", "h2"=>"The move could trigger impeachment proceedings against President Obama, said his senior adviser, Dan Pfeiffer.

A lot of people in Washington laughed off Sarah Palin’s call to impeach the president for executive overreach, Pfeiffer said, but “I would not discount that possibility.” Polling shows strong support for the idea among the GOP base, he said, adding that House Speaker John Boehner (R) of Ohio has opened the door to the possibility with his lawsuit against Obama. Recommended: Could you pass a US citizenship test? Speaker Boehner has flatly denied an interest in impeachment, saying, “I disagree” with those who support it. Next week, the GOP-controlled House is expected to pass a resolution to sue the president for executive overreach on the Affordable Care Act , or “Obamacare.” Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 07/24 “This is a fundraising exercise for Democrats ,” said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel in an e-mail response to Pfeiffer’s impeachment comments. “It is telling, and sad, that a senior White House official is focused on political games, rather than helping these kids and securing the border.\" In 2012, Obama signed a memo authorizing deferred action on the deportation of certain children of illegal immigrants – the so-called “DREAMers.” Republicans cite it as an example of executive overreach and say it has encouraged the influx of unaccompanied minors from Central America. Tea party favorite Sen. Ted Cruz (R) of Texas has urged his colleagues to reject emergency funding for the current border crisis unless the Obama administration rolls back the deferred action. But while some may have thought the child-migrant crisis might discourage the president from further executive action on immigration, it is having the opposite effect. It has raised awareness of immigration as an issue and increased “the urgency” that the public feels in fixing it, Pfeiffer said. That gives the administration “broad permission” to take action, he said. Given the “broken Congress,” Pfeiffer said, Obama plans to move ahead with another action after he hears advice from the attorney general and the Homeland Security secretary. His criteria will be that any executive action be on “solid legal footing” and have maximum impact. Immigrant groups want the president to use his “prosecutorial discretion” to extend temporary protection from deportation to the millions of illegal migrants who would have qualified for a “path to citizenship” under the Senate’s bipartisan immigration reform, which has gone nowhere in the House. Politico reports he’s considering subsets of that group, based on criteria such as family ties, how long they have been in the country, and work history. The White House, Pfeiffer said, is also considering what impact an action could have on the politics of reform going forward. After the announcement of an action, he said, Republicans will have a choice: “Are they going to go back and try to pass comprehensive immigration reform – [after] which the president will rip up whatever executive action he does the day they pass that? Or are they basically going to set themselves up for the next two and a half years here to be arguing to elect a Republican in order to deport all these people?” On the child-migrant crisis, Pfeiffer said Obama still supports changing a 2008 child-trafficking law that has become a sticking point in his request to Congress for $3.7 billion in emergency funding. That law has had the unintended effect of creating a huge backlog of immigration cases for unaccompanied minors in the courts. Republicans and some Democrats in Congress support changing the law to expedite the cases and deportations, but many Democrats say changing the law would deprive endangered children of their due process. The administration is talking with members of Congress about a change. But that issue, Pfeiffer said, should not hold up funding. On a related issue, he neither denied nor confirmed a New York Times account that the White House is considering a plan to accept refugees from Honduras whose applications are processed in that country.", "score"=>164.10336, "summaryTitle"=>"Obama will take executive action on immigration after summer, adviser says", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"The move could trigger impeachment proceedings against President Obama, said his senior adviser, Dan Pfeiffer.

Justin Matthew Sargent and Rebecca Faulkenberry in Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark on Broadway. (© Seth Walters) Broadway producer Michael Cohl dished the dirt on a handful of Broadway productions in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal . According to Cohl, the now-closed, infamous Broadway production will set out on an arena tour in place of the previously announced Las Vegas production. He plans to launch the tour in \"late 2015 or winter 2016.\" \"I think Spider-Man is a pop culture rock show that was meant to be in arenas,\" Cohl said. The Broadway production of Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark ended its three-year run at the Foxwoods Theatre on January 4, 2014. Inspired by the Marvel comic-book series, the musical features a score by Bono and The Edge and a book by Julie Taymor, Glen Berger, and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. The $75 million Broadway production began performances November 28, 2010, and set the record for the most previews ever in Broadway history — 182. Cohl also discussed the recently canceled tour of Jesus Christ Superstar , which he called \"a disaster,\" explaining that ticket sales had been \"terrible.\" He also divulged plans to premiere a stage version of the Fox animated film Rio in Brazil in 2016. Cohl went on to say that he'd like to bring the show to Broadway following that premiere.

Leshner, to decry the magazine’s use of a lurid photograph to illustrate a story on battling HIV/AIDS in Southeast Asia. The July cover of the magazine showed transgender women in tight dresses and high heels with their heads cropped out of the photograph. “The decision to publish a sexist, racist, and transphobic cover speaks volumes to how men in the science fields view and treat women. To use headless, sexualized women of color to illustrate treating the AIDS pandemic is extremely offensive,” Congresswoman Speier said. “A Science editor’s comment that it would be ‘interesting’ to see how men felt after learning the women are transgender is an abysmal motivation for the choice of cover. Transgender people are already disproportionately subject to hate crimes.” Research shows that women earn about half the doctorates in the science and engineering fields in the United States, but only comprise 21 percent of full science professors, 5 percent of full engineering professors, and 28 percent of the overall workforce. Female resumes are viewed more negatively, male scientists train fewer female students , and female scientists 37 percent less grant funding. Read the letter Congresswoman Speier sent to Leshner here . ### Congresswoman Jackie Speier is proud to represent California’s 14th Congressional District, which includes parts of San Francisco and San Mateo counties. She is a senior member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and the House Armed Services Committee (HASC). In her role on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the Congresswoman is a ranking member on the Subcommittee on Energy Policy, Health Care, and Entitlements and serves on the Subcommittee on National Security. She serves on the Readiness Subcommittee and the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee on HASC and is a member of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force.

The <B>search</B> for the third room, undertaken in the midst of suffering", "content"=>"‹ Previous Post   |   Blog Home Arts & Culture The Vale of Soul-Making July 25, 2014 | by Jeffrey C. Johnson How Keats coped with fever. In 1821, three months after he learned of Keats’s death, Percy Shelley wrote Adonaïs: An Elegy on the Death of John Keats , in which he described the poet as a delicate, fragile young flower of a man: Oh gentle child, beautiful as thou wert, Why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men Too soon, and with weak hands though mighty heart Dare the unpastured dragon in his den? That dragon was a cruel critic who had mocked Keats’s literary ambitions—John Gibson Lockhart, who, writing under the pseudonym Z, had scolded Keats as if he were a child, insisting in a review of Endymion that “it is a better and a wiser thing to be a starved apothecary than a starved poet; so back to the shop, Mr John, back to the ‘plasters, pills, and ointment boxes.’ ” Lockhart had classed Keats among the Cockney School of politics, versification, and morality, known—at least by readers of Blackwood’s Magazine —for its “exquisitely bad taste” and “vulgar modes of thinking.” In Shelley’s formulation, it was this bad review that sent Keats to an early grave, and gazing back through history, one begins to accept this two-part narrative of Keats’s legacy. The fallen poet had lived a life of abstractions—he was not only an aesthete, but the aesthete—and he had been, as Byron quipped, “snuffed out by an article,” too beautiful and frail for this harsh world. But Keats was immersed in the realities of life; his poetry and letters reveal an allegiance to radical politics as well as a concern with economic and scientific issues. Far from childlike and apolitical, he’s now thought of as having been “dangerous … a poet who embodied and gave voice to the anxieties and insecurities of his times … a poet whom the establishment would be obliged to silence,” as the scholar Nicholas Roe puts it. We often overlook, for instance, that Keats spent six years studying medicine, successfully earning a license to practice in London from the Society of Apothecaries—hence Lockhart’s insult about the “plasters, pills, and ointment boxes.” To think that he was “snuffed out by an article” trivializes the intense pain he experienced as his lungs were slowly consumed by tuberculosis, robbing him of his work, his love, and his life at the age of twenty-five. The myth of the frail genius is attractive, even to contemporary readers, because of its quintessential Romanticism. But the truth is that Keats’s writings—especially when they seem fanciful or escapist—are grounded in real-world concerns. And nowhere is this more evident than in the letters and poems of his that deal with feverish suffering. During the early nineteenth century, London had fallen into the grip of fever mania. The city was working to combat a host of diseases associated with the colonies: yellow fever, typhus, influenza, smallpox, child-bed fevers, agues, and St. Anthony’s fire, among many others. With almost a million people living in the city in the early 1800s, including more than ten thousand prostitutes, disease spread quickly, inducing public panic. Between 1816 and 1817, the number of admissions to the Fever Hospital spiked from 124 to 781, and the fever epidemic remained a major news story for the duration of Keats’s life. Whereas some historians have viewed the fever as a foreign invader, striking from the colonies upon the homeland, Keats would have recognized it as a recurrent, intimate presence that followed him throughout his life. The patients whom he attended at Guy’s Hospital haunted him, as did the memory of his mother’s fatal consumptive fever, which he would relive as he nursed his brother, Tom, throughout 1818. Because of his family’s history of illness, his own medical training, and the epidemic of fever that spread throughout London, Keats was intimately familiar with feverish suffering; he used his writing to make sense of a pain for which there was no reasonable explanation. Two letters—one written before Tom’s death and one after—outline Keats’s philosophy of suffering as a creative force. * * * On May 3, 1818, Keats wrote a letter to his friend, John Hamilton Reynolds, comparing a human lifespan to “a large Mansion of Many Apartments.” He imagined two rooms in a mansion through which one must pass before confronting a vast number of potential third rooms. For an unspecified length of time, one remains unthinkingly in the first apartment, in spite of the fact that the doors leading to the second are wide open. Eventually, the impetus to think moves one from the first chamber into this second, called the “Chamber of Maiden-Thought,” which is full of intoxicating delights and thus initially very pleasing. But time spent within it leads to a “sharpening [of] one’s vision into the heart and nature of Man … convincing ones nerves that the World is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness and oppression.” One becomes aware of one’s own fever and the suffering that afflicts humanity—which were present all the while, even amid the delights. Keats thought he’d only made it to the end of this second room. He saw nothing but darkness and mist in the hallway beyond it. He told Reynolds that he wished to explore the dark passages to seek out some form of salvation by way of his poetry, though he offered no compelling evidence that any of the unexplored rooms might contain something redemptive, or even pleasant. Surrounding this philosophical discussion are the details of Tom’s illness. The letter begins with what appears to be good news: “After a Night without a Wink of sleep, and overburdened with fever, [Tom] has got up after a refreshing day sleep and is better than he has been for a long time,” and ends with restrained melancholy: “Tom has spit a leetle [ for little] blood this afternoon, and that is rather a damper.” But insofar as Keats was hoping to justify the purpose of suffering to himself, both of these statements are heartbreaking. Because of his extensive experience with ill patients, Keats surely knew that his brother’s condition was grim, even in May 1818. His reactions hint at a kind of denial—an insistence that there be an identifiable purpose to justify the trauma he continued to witness and endure. And once he has convinced himself that there is a purpose to suffering, it is only another small leap to start thinking of the fever as something constructive. Indeed, as odd as it may seem, it was his brother’s grim condition that prompted, even forced, Keats to expand his philosophy of suffering to embrace fever as beneficial. The search for the third room, undertaken in the midst of suffering, had to lead to the creation of something meaningful and redemptive, as Keats would try to convince himself after Tom’s death in December 1818. * * * In the spring of 1819, Keats was at the height of his genius; within the next few months he would write his finest poems. In a letter from April 21, 1819 to his other brother, George, who had emigrated to America, Keats revisited his philosophy, unveiling the “system of Spirit-creation” that he’d been designing and testing for more than a year: the world as the “vale of Soul-making.” Keats argued that any attempts to improve one’s life still end in death—a fate that he acknowledged as unbearable without some notion of redemption. And yet he rejected the idea of the afterlife or religious salvation—those, in his view, devalue the act of suffering, because they serve no creative purpose and teach nothing to the human individual. Instead, he referred to the raw material of a soul as an “intelligence.” All humans have (or are ) an intelligence, but they’re not considered souls until they develop an individual identity. Soul creation takes place over the span of many years and requires two components—the human heart and the world of feverish suffering—comprising a process that Keats likens to an education: I will call the world a School instituted for the purpose of teaching little children to read—I will call the human heart the horn Book used in that School—and I will call the Child able to read , the Soul made from that school and its hornbook . Do you not see how necessary a World of Pains and troubles is to school an Intelligence and make it a soul? A Place where the heart must feel and suffer in a thousand diverse ways! The “vale of Soul-making” celebrated the fever that had followed him through his life. And yet what Keats could not, or refused to, see is that the irrationality he perceived in religious salvation is present in his own system, too. There’s no ultimate purpose to the suffering that he, his family, and his patients have had to endure; it’s not as if the fever of tuberculosis consciously, benevolently struck Keats’s mother and brother to help them shape their souls. But Keats went to great lengths to convince himself of just that. While the fever had surrounded him for most of his life, it consumed Keats during the months following Tom’s death, insisting that he find some way to rationalize its irrational effects. In fact, compared with other medical terms, Keats uses the word fever sparingly in his poems: blood is explicitly referenced forty-seven times (and implicitly in at least a dozen other instances), and there are 157 variations of heart , but only twenty-three instances of fever appear across the body of Keats’s poetry. This shouldn’t mislead us into thinking that it’s a less potent image for him. His prudent use of the term demonstrates its importance—it’s loaded with personal significance. All but five of these uses of “fever” occur after Tom became ill, the most poignant of which comes in “Ode to a Nightingale,” written only a few days after the “vale of Soul-making” letter. The feverish heart overwhelms the speaker of the “Ode to a Nightingale,” who suffers a heartache as he listens to the nightingale’s song, hoping to mirror the bird’s ability to transcend real-world circumstances. The speaker describes the world as The weariness, the fever, and the fret    Here, where men sit and hear each other groan; Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,    Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;      Where but to think is to be full of sorrow            And leaden-eyed despairs. Keats must have had Tom’s death in mind when he composed these lines; every phrase is loaded with the common suffering of humanity from which the nightingale’s song seems to escape. Less than two years later, Keats died of tuberculosis in Italy, where he’d traveled in the hope of recovering, accompanied by the artist Joseph Severn. Even as he grew shorter and shorter of breath in early 1821, Keats repeatedly rejected his dear friend Severn’s belief in the afterlife, suggesting that he was committed to his philosophy of Soul-making until the end. Severn wrote in mid-January: “this noble fellow lying on the bed—is dying in horror—no kind hope smoothing down his suffering—no philosophy—no religion to support him.” When the end came, it was the fever, and not an article with obvious political motivations, that killed Keats. The pleasures of his life—beauty, love, poetry—had always been bundled up with suffering and death, and we may empathize with him in his desire to articulate a purpose to it all. He was not too frail for the world: his devotion to making the most of his mortality drove his creative process. He was a man who had a deep need to create meaning where there was none. Jeffrey C.

Co-defendants Carl Wayne Bruce and Rachel Lynn Bruce were taken into custody by Oscoda County Sherriff Department deputies July 23, and then arraigned on the charges July 24 in Oscoda County’s 81st District Court, each on a count of felony murder in the death of Mio resident Herman Ritchey Jr. According to the charges, Ritchey’s death was the result of alleged adult abuse against him by his daughter and son-in-law. If convicted, they could face life in prison for the alleged crimes The Bruces were also each charged with first degree vulnerable adult abuse for allegedly intentionally causing serious physical and/or mental harm to Ritchey. They also both were arraigned on a felony second-degree charge for adult abuse against Ritchey. The pair is currently being held in the Ogenaw County Jail in West Branch. According to a press release issued by Morse-Bills, a judge denied bond due to the seriousness of the alleged offenses. According to information provided by Bills, Ritchey was reported dead Oct. 24, 2012 by the Bruces, who were caring for the 72-year-old man at the time in Mio. Law enforcement and medical examiners responded to the scene, allegedly finding Ritchey located in a secluded bedroom, severely malnourished, and with large open sores and scabs on his body, according to Morse-Bills. Further investigation revealed that Ritchey had allegedly been left clothed in soiled garments for a minimum of two days, had not been properly administered his prescribed medications, and had been left in his closed bedroom where he could be found crawling on the floor, according to a press release. There were also issues with Ritchey’s prescription medicines, which in some cases had allegedly not been administered properly, or had not been refilled since the prior year. Morse-Bills said further investigation of Ritchey’s medical examiner investigation report, medical history, pharmaceutical history, and financial records revealed that Ritchey had not been seen or treated by a medical professional since March of 2011 and had been receiving a substantial amount of veteran and social security monetary benefits, but was never provided with services or treatment necessary for his care. The medical examiner investigation report identified Ritchey’s immediate cause of death as malnutrition due to dementia and neglect said Morse-Bills.", "score"=>163.91898, "summaryTitle"=>"Married couple faces life in prison for alleged murder", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>"us-mi", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://oscodaherald.com/stories/Married-couple-faces-life-in-prison-for-alleged-murder,99782", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1nDEAoV", "lastseen"=>"20140726004606", "page"=>"http://oscodaherald.com/stories/married-couple-faces-life-in-prison-for-alleged-murder,99782"}, {"domain"=>"kutv.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406317529000", "h2"=>"News Photos & Videos - Submit Your Photos Here", "site"=>"www.kutv.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004532", "keywords"=>", KUTV.com Utah News, Utah Breaking News, Utah Weather, Utah Sports", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335532741", "title"=>"Toddler crashes Jeep, runs home to watch cartoons | KUTV.com", "initial"=>"20140725194529", "summaryText"=>"MYRTLE CREEK, Ore.

The Lapeer County Sheriff's Department, Metamora Township Police Department and Lapeer County Animal Control spent Friday afternoon removing dogs from the home on Thomas Road, south of Brauer Road in Metamora. Sheriff's officials confirmed more than five dogs and puppies were removed but Metamora Township Police said more information would be made public on Monday. The homeowners were not at home when the dogs were taken, according to officials. Police also searched the back yard and cages while on the property, although it didn't immediately appear that anything else was taken from the residence. The removal comes two days after police said two 3-year-old Cane Corsos attacked and killed Craig Sytsma, 46, of Livonia as he ran along the road after work at about 5:30 on Wednesday afternoon. A Cane Corso is described by the  American Kennel Club  as a \"mastiff type\" dog that ranges in size from 23 1/2 to 27 1/2 inches tall at the shoulder. The two dogs from the attack are in quarantine  at Lapeer County Animal Control. It was unclear where the dogs and puppies were taken. Sytsma was working at Eltro Services in Oxford when he decided to go for a run just before 5:30 p.m.,  said Metamora Township Police Chief David Mallett. Mallett said Sytsma began his run heading northbound on Thomas Road from M-24. He said about two miles in, just south of Brauer Road, a witness reported seeing Sytsma running and said the men waved at each other as the man was mowing his lawn. It was as the man made another pass with his mower that Mallett said the witness saw something was wrong. The original call to police came in as a man was shot and another man had a gun, Mallett said. It wasn't until Metamora Township officer Sean Leathers arrived that he realized it wasn't a shooting, but an animal attack. Mallett said Leathers kept the animals at bay while first responders worked to try and save Sytsma. Mallett said there was a report of a dog bite in May 2012 where the animal did come back to the same address. Another report was taken in November 2013 after a man between 60 and 70 years old was bitten and taken to the hospital.  Susanna Nolan, who lives just down several houses from the incident, said she knows the person involved in the second incident and said this is \"absolutely appalling,\" but wasn't surprised knowing the history of the dogs. Although she didn't see anything the night of the event, she  said she's heartbroken for Sytsma's family. \"I'm hoping a strong message is sent ... so everyone will take notice,\" she said. She said she's \"just plain nervous\" about the dogs down the road. \"I want to know how they were allowed to keep the dogs after the two incidents,\" she said.", "score"=>163.81718, "summaryTitle"=>"More dogs taken from home after deadly mauling of jogger in Lapeer County", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Several more dogs were removed from a home two days after two dogs chased and killed a man down the road from the house in Metamora.", "cities"=>"us-mi", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/07/more_dogs_taken_from_home_wher.html", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1AhahKl", "lastseen"=>"20140726004410", "page"=>"http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/07/more_dogs_taken_from_home_wher.html", "ogtitle"=>"More dogs taken from home after deadly mauling of jogger in Lapeer County"}, {"domain"=>"wbtv.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406332848000", "h3"=>["Prosecutors consider charges after burglar killed", "Prosecutors consider charges after burglar killed", "Man posts Facebook photos of him pointing gun at cat & dog", "Man posts Facebook photos of him pointing gun at cat & dog", "Walterboro woman reunited with puppy months after car crash", "Walterboro woman reunited with puppy months after car crash", "Fruit recall expanded due to listeria concerns", "Fruit recall expanded due to listeria concerns", "Report: Drunk Union Co. inmates compete in push-up contest", "Report: Drunk Union Co. inmates compete in push-up contest", "Man posts Facebook photos of him pointing gun at cat & dog", "Man posts Facebook photos of him pointing gun at cat & dog", "Mustang week crash videos surface on social media", "Mustang week crash videos surface on social media", "Macy's Story", "Macy's Story", "Unknown person leaves porcelain dolls on CA doorsteps", "Unknown person leaves porcelain dolls on CA doorsteps", "A true love letter", "A true love letter", "SLIDESHOW", "Manhunt Monday: Fugitives on the loose", "Manhunt Monday: Fugitives on the loose", "News Feed", "News Feed", "Sports Feed", "Sports Feed", "RSS Feeds", "RSS Feeds"], "site"=>"www.wbtv.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004652", "keywords"=>"wwe, world, heavyweight, champion, burglar", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335612403", "title"=>"Former WWE World Heavyweight Champion takes down home burglar - WBTV 3 News, Weather, Sports, and Traffic for Charlotte, NC", "initial"=>"20140726000048", "summaryText"=>"Each week, CBS 5's Manhunt Monday focuses on a wanted fugitive or fugitives sought by law enforcement. Browse through the photo gallery to see if you know anyone on the run.", "content"=>"Each week, CBS 5's Manhunt Monday focuses on a wanted fugitive or fugitives sought by law enforcement. Browse through the photo gallery to see if you know anyone on the run.", "score"=>163.7889, "summaryTitle"=>"Former WWE World Heavyweight Champion takes down home burglar - WBTV 3 News, Weather, Sports, and Traffic for Charlotte, NC", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"A home burglar quickly realized he picked the wrong house to break into, when the homeowner, a former WWE World Heavyweight Champion, took him down.", "cities"=>["us-nc", "us-sc"], "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.wbtv.com/story/26115742/wwe-world-heavyweight-champion-detains-home-burglar", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1t5ywsQ", "lastseen"=>"20140726004646", "page"=>"http://www.wbtv.com/story/26115742/wwe-world-heavyweight-champion-detains-home-burglar", "ogtitle"=>"Former WWE World Heavyweight Champion takes down home burglar"}, {"domain"=>"tennis-warehouse.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406327421000", "site"=>"www.tennis-warehouse.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004720", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335640882", "title"=>"Zepp Sensors and Accessories", "initial"=>"20140725223021", "summaryText"=>"Zepp Tennis Sensor & Racquet Mount", "content"=>"Zepp Tennis Sensor & Racquet Mount", "score"=>163.77971, "summaryTitle"=>"Zepp Sensors and Accessories", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/zepp.html", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1kfCzAq", "lastseen"=>"20140726004717", "page"=>"http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/zepp.html"}, {"domain"=>"fmylife.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406327420000", "h3"=>["Élodie's illustrated FML", "Categories", "FML's blog", "FMyLife, world tour"], "site"=>"www.fmylife.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140725235457", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406332497660", "title"=>"FML:", "initial"=>"20140725223020", "summaryText"=>"A lot of people will spout off the tired old cliché that the destination isn't as important as the journey itself.

The changes will be visible within the Google Maps search results and Google Web search results. The core changes are behind the scenes, but it does impact local search results rankings and some local businesses may notice an increase or decrease in web site referrals, leads and business from the change. Google told us that the new local search algorithm ties deeper into their web search capabilities, including the hundreds of ranking signals they use in web search along with search features such as Knowledge Graph, spelling correction, synonyms and more. In addition, Google said that this new algorithm improves their distance and location ranking parameters. The new algorithm is currently rolling out for US English results and aims to provide a more useful and relevant experience for searchers seeking local results. Google didn’t share any details about if and when the update would roll out more widely in other countries and languages. Google has not commented on the percent of queries impacted by this algorithm update, nor if certain web spam algorithms were deployed in this update. If you have noticed any ranking changes and referral changes for your local business, please let us know in the comments.

When putting this list together, the fun factor was first and foremost, but we also considered the swag bags, after parties, locations, charitable affiliations, and, of course the hilarious memories you'll collect along with your finisher medal. So lace up those kicks (and maybe start working on your gag reflex), because we’re off! EAT AND RUN   1. April Fool’s Day Twinkie Run Distance: 5K Location: Ann Arbor, MI Twinkies are a serious matter—you saw how people lost it when the factory shutdown was announced—and this event honors the legendary shortcake snack. Runners are treated to unlimited Twinkies at the starting line and then let loose to run a 5K through Ann Arbor’s Gallup Park. For those who need to refuel, the spongy cakes are available at the 1.5-mile mark, and again at the finish line as a…recovery snack. Be sure to pace yourself though; there are even more Twinkies post-race (those ones are homemade and more decadent than you’d ever believe). This run, now in its fifth year, is organized by Ann Arbor Active Against ALS . 2. Hot Chocolate 5K/15K Distance: 5K and 15K Location: Various Nothing compares to the sweet warmth of hot chocolate on a cold winter’s day, except for maybe the Hot Chocolate 15/5K Finisher’s Mug filled with chocolate fondue, dip-able snacks and, of course, hot chocolate. But first you’ve got to go the distance: 3.1 miles or 9.3 miles, through your city of choice (Chicago, Denver, Philadelphia, and San Francisco among 10 others). Now in its sixth year, the run draws more than 200,000 chocolate lovers nationwide, with a portion of proceeds benefiting the Ronald McDonald House Charities. 3. Krispy Kreme Challenge Distance: 5 miles Location: Raleigh, NC Who doesn’t dream of a doughnut break during their run? But a dozen doughnuts?! Those who accept the Krispy Kreme Challenge will never look at the sweet treat the same way again. The run kicks off on the campus of North Carolina State University in Raleigh and directs sugar-hungry challengers 2.5 miles through historic downtown Raleigh to a Krispy Kreme shop where they devour one dozen original glazed doughnuts before trudging the 2.5 miles back to campus. Catch is, you’ve got to finish the run—and every last doughnut—in less than an hour to be recognized as a challenger. If you’re not into downing 2,280 calories all at once you can register as a casual runner, which merely requires you to balance the box all the way back to the finish line. This event is in its 10th year and benefits the North Carolina Children’s Hospital. 4. New York Hot Dog Challenge Distance: 3 to 5 miles Location: New York, NY Some hot dog-eating competitions are for amateurs, and others are for champions—as in those of you who can down 10 hot dogs (buns and all) while hustling along a 3-to-5-mile course through busy Midtown Manhattan. Participants race from hot dog vendor to hot dog vendor, but they don’t know where the vendors will be set up until race day (event organize keep the course map secret to prevent practice runs). Participants are assigned a referee to ensure each dog is completely devoured before runners head to the next cart. Runners have to fork over the dough for each dog, so sponsorship is allowed. Oh, and puking disqualifies you. 5. NYC Pizza Run Distance: 2.25 miles Location: New York, NY Who serves New York City’s best slice will probably always be up for debate, but what you can find out for sure is whether or not you’re able to scarf down three slices while running 2.25 miles through the gritty streets of Manhattan’s Lower East Side. The NYC Pizza Run is an annual challenge held in Tompkins Square Park (four laps around the park, counterclockwise) in which you must finish a slice (crust and all) at the start of each lap before continuing onto the next. The first runner to finish is crowned the NYC Pizza Run Champion and the fun continues down the block at Common Ground, a local pub, where participants get a free drink to wash it all down. Now in its fifth year, a portion of the run’s proceeds benefit the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International. 6. The Corndog Challenge Distance: 5K Location: Tulsa, OK You’ve never experienced the Tulsa State Fair quite like this—covered in sweat and with a belly full of carnival treats. Ok, maybe that’s how most of us experience state fairs, but still. The Corn Dog Challenge is going to show you something you’ve never seen before as it leads you on a certified and timed 5K course through the fairgrounds during the beginning stages of fair set-up. Oh, and did we mention you’ll be required to fill your belly with lemonade, cotton candy, and a corndog along the way? With each mile you complete, you’ll be handed one of these snacks to devour before racing on. For those not looking to bite into a challenge quite like this, there’s always the Corndog Classic 5K, in which you’ll get the same behind-the-scenes views without the calories. Proceeds from the event, which is in its fourth year, benefit the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society and Tulsa Area United Way. 7. The Wicked Wine Run Distance: 5K Location: Various When you know there’s a glass (or three) of wine waiting for you at the finish line, you might just log a new PR. The Wicked Wine Run leads runners on a 5K through a lush vineyard—think trail running with grapes. In addition to the run, the wine connoisseur in you can take part in the 1K Tasting Walk, which features four wine-tasting stops along the route. Be sure to hang around for the post-run concert and relaxing sunset. Get in Character   8. A Christmas Story Run Distance: 5K and 10K Location: Cleveland, OH This holiday season, why not take a run down movie memory lane? Register for either a 5K or 10K that takes participants through A Christmas Story ’s set locations in picturesque Cleveland, OH. If you're a fan of the movie, nothing says Christmas quite like runners in pink bunny suits, lampshade hats, and Santa beards jostling along to chants of, “ You’ll shoot your eye out! ,”\" Oooh fuuudge! ,\" and \" Fra-gee-lay. That must be Italian! \" The run kicks off at the site of the former Higbee’s Department Store and makes its way 3.1 miles to A Christmas Story House & Museum . The 10K course heads back toward Public Square, a plaza in downtown Cleveland, where the classic holiday flick will be playing on a Jumbotron. Race entry includes entrance to the house and museum, and automatically enters runners in a drawing to win their very own leg lamp ! Race proceeds benefit A Christmas Story House Neighborhood Restoration Project. 9. Boston Urban Idiotorama Distance: 3.5 miles Location: Boston, MA If you’re a team player with an imagination (who also happens to enjoy a beer or two) then this run is for you. All you’ve got to do is get four to six fast friends together (make sure they’re at least 21), find a shopping cart, stock up on canned goods, and register for the Boston Urban Idiotorama. The event copies the format of the Iditarod, the famous Alaskan sled dog race . In the Idiotorama costumed runners and their themed shopping carts criss-cross Boston, checking in at five local bars along the way. But why the cart? With each check-in runners encourage spectators to donate as much food as possible for the Boston Medical Center Food Pantry. 10. Caliente Bare Dare 5K Distance: 5K Location: Land O'Lakes, FL “I swear, I could be making such better time if it weren’t for these darn clothes!” If this thought has ever crossed your mind while sweating through a 5K, then you may want to strip down for the Caliente Bare Dare. While nudity is not required, it really is suggested—not being in the nude means you’d totally stick out like a clothed thumb as you made your way through the trail course. The 5K takes place every year at Caliente, an upscale clothing-optional resort located in Land O'Lakes, FL. The event features a poolside afterparty, as well as a day pass to the resort. (If you wear nothing else, be sure to throw on sunscreen and sneakers.) 11. Cupid’s Undie Run Distance: 1 mile Location: Various Cupid’s Undie Run has runners charging from the starting line quicker than the little cherub’s arrow, because well, this mile(ish) run takes place on a frigid February weekend with participants in their Valentine’s Day best—yes, negligees, cotton bloomers, and assorted underthings. Runners warm up with a two-hour pre-party before the sprint and defrost with a post-race dance-off. Organized in cities across the country, proceeds benefit The Children’s Tumor Foundation. 12. Mustache Dache Distance: 5K Location: Various We mustache you a question: Are you up for a dash to the finish line? Alright, alright, we promise, this 5K isn’t nearly as corny as that joke. The Mustache Dache is actually pretty awesome. This charitable race benefits Movember , a foundation promoting prostate cancer awareness. You’ll swear you’ve never seen so many Steve Prefontaines in your life! Participants are encouraged to grow out their upper lip best for the mustache contest that follows the race. Even the ladies and kids will be rocking ‘staches for this one, courtesy of a face-painter who will be on hand to wisp on the whiskers. (Oh, and don’t be surprised if you see a life-size mustache racing past you on the course or busting out the Charleston at the afterparty.) 13. Rock ‘n’ Roll Series Distance: 5K, 10K, half, full, and relay Location: Various You know how important a solid playlist can be. So just think how amped you’ll be when you’re running to live bands spread out along the course of your choice—5K, 10K, half-marathon, marathon, or relay. Local bands line routes in cities all over the world, performing a variety of genres, from alternative, classic, and punk rock to blues, jazz and soul. Where the tunes fade out, cheer teams and dance squads are on hand to perform and turn up the energy. You might be surprised how a sing-along can give you that second wind you need! 14. runDisney Distance: 5K, 10K, half-marathon, and marathon Location: Anaheim, CA and Lake Buena Vista, FL All your running dreams are sure to come true becase runDisney offers half-marathons, marathons, 10-milers, and adventure races, all featuring your favorite Disney themes! Light on your feet? There’s the Tinkerbell Half Marathon Weekend at Disneyland featuring a Tinkerbell half, 10K, and Neverland Family Fun Run 5K. Maybe you’re craving a new PR? If so, bite into the Wine & Dine Half Marathon Weekend at Disney World featuring a night-time half marathon winding through three parks and finishing with an afterparty at the Epcot International Food & Wine Festival. Just don’t forget, it’s all about wearing your Disney best ! 15. Superhero Scramble Distance: 4 miles, 8 miles, half-marathon, and marathon Location: Various Calling all superheroes! There is a menace wreaking athletic havoc in your town, in the form of obstacle races of varying distances and increasing difficulty! The Charger (a 4-miler ), the Intimidator (8 miles), the Villain (13 miles), and a Super Villain (26 miles) all must be conquered. So switch out of those civilian clothes and slide into the spandex, because your resilience, strength, endurance, and superhero abilities are about to be tested. For those on top of their evil-fighting game, you can enter the Scramble Gamble , in which you put your money where your fitness is for a payoff in prizes. 16. The Bad Prom Run Distance: 5K Location: Various Some things are so bad that they’re actually pretty awesome, one being The Bad Prom Run. This 5K makes up for where your prom fell flat. Run (or dance) your way through four light-up-the-night prom themes along the course, while an epic soundtrack bumps in the background. Don’t worry about bringing a date though, just focus on dressing for the occasion, and be sure that your running shoes totally complement your look, because you never know whose eye you’ll catch during the afterparty. A portion of your prom ticket will go toward a local charity. 17. The Zombie Run Distance: 5K Location: Various Didn’t you know? Zombies have more fun, at least during this 5K run. If you’re into running with the undead, sign up as a zombie. After you get all gore-i-fied (at the hands of a professional makeup artist) you’re let loose into a sea of fresh flesh to chase the runners who have registered as humans and steal their “life flags.”  Those who sign up to run as humans must finish the run with at least one of the three flags received at the starting line. The course is designed like a zombie movie set: After the first kilometer you'll enter a military-controlled apocalypse zone and strive to survive while darting through chemical spill zones and past car crashes and away from zombies. Regardless of whether or not you survive you’ll still be allowed to finish the race. For an extra 10 bucks you can buy another flag—proceeds go to kids battling brain injuries and disorders at Kennedy Krieger Institute. 18. The Tribal Run Distance: 120-mile relay Location: Various We hope your spirit animal happens to be a quick one, and into late-night adventures. Gather a group of runners and head out on a 120-mile relay race through the wild. The race begins Friday afternoon, and continues through the night, finishing Saturday sometime between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. (on average the run takes about 20 hours to complete). All tribes will run relay style, rotating through all three loops, which are lit solely with candles. (Your spirit animal is required to run with a headlamp.) It is an experience that mixes the best of running, camping, tribal dance performances, fierce costumes, and more. Awards are given for quickest time on each loop, best team costume, best team name, and best team campsite. Take on a Challenge   19. Armageddon Ambush Distance: 5K Location: Various It’s the end of the world as we know it! Only thing is, we didn’t know it would be so darn colorful. Armageddon Ambush is a strenuous 5K mud and obstacle course designed to challenge your desire to make it out alive (or at least to the beer-filled afterparty). You’ll be directed along a rugged course toward 15 to 20 end-of-the-world disaster obstacles while being ambushed with color bombs. 20. Dirty Girl 5k Mud Run Distance: 5K Location: Various Hey, ladies … you ready to get dirty? This mud-drenched obstacle race will have you kicking butt and taking names.

The top 25 qualifying teams receive an invitation to the National Championship Race. 22. Reebok Spartan Race Distance: 3 miles, 8 miles, and 12 miles Location: Various “There is fire, mud, water, barbed wire, and occasionally Hell on Earth,” warn race promoters. Ah, nothing a Spartan can’t handle, right? Each one of the Spartan races—Spartan Sprint (3 miles, 15 obstacles),  Super Spartan (8 miles, 20 obstacles), and Spartan Beast (12 miles, 25 obstacles)—were designed by eight athletes who understood the importance of quick decision-making in the face of adversity. But are you a Spartan? Can you drag boulders on chains, flip logs, and lug tires distances you never imagined at speeds you never thought impossible? Well, there’s only one way to find out. 23. ROC Race Distance: 5K Location: Various It’s all fun and games until someone gets taken down by the Sweeper, a gigantic rotating obstacle. Ok, it’s still fun and games even after being taken down by the Sweeper; because that’s exactly what the ROC Race is–one big game show-inspired obstacle run featuring 12 larger-than-life obstacles. Being that the race is untimed, you’ll be able to better focus on making it over the enormous jump balls, through the tire mile and down the world’s largest inflatable water slide. Proceeds benefit the Challenged Athletes Foundation. 24. Tough Mudder Distance: 10 to 12 miles Location: Various Tough Mudders are team players.

The course is actually purposefully designed to make Mudders rely on each other for physical and mental boosts. Clocking a good time is great, but pushing boundaries and overcoming all obstacles through teamwork, now that’s a challenge for a Tough Mudder.   25.

Since unveiling the Warrior Dash in 2009, more than a million runners have claimed the title of warrior, raising $7.5 million (and counting) to  benefit St. Jude Children’s Hospital. This year the battle becomes more intense as the top 25 male and top 25 female finishers of each regular season Warrior Dash compete in the Warrior Dash World Championship for a $100,000 prize. After conquering the Battleground, Warriors celebrate with turkey legs, beer steins, and live music at a post-race party. Brighten Up   26. The Electric Run Distance: 5K Location: Various There ain’t no life like the nightlife, and there ain’t no night run quite like The Electric Run. Runners decked out in blinking, shining, glowing lights literally transform the 5K course into a nightclub that’s out of this world. The course features glowing neon columns and arches that change colors to the beat of the music, tunnels with dancing patterns and figures on the walls, ceilings, and floors, and fluorescent fountains flowing to the rhythm. The finish line spills runners out in front of a main stage where the lights and sounds are kicked up a notch for an electric dance party. 27. The Color Run Distance: 5K Location: Various Now that happiness is what it’s all about ( thank you, Pharrell ) what better time to run the “Happiest 5K on the Planet”? The Color Run, with more than 170 events in 30-plus countries, practically paints a smile on participants’ faces. During this 5K, runners dressed in all white barrel through clouds of vibrant paint powder, all the while trying to catch their breath between bouts of pure giddiness. More than half of the participants are first-time 5K runners, which makes The Color Run the perfect catalyst for encouraging participants to keep up with the active, healthy lifestyle. 28. The Blacklight Run Distance: 5K Location: Various This will be one of those few times in which you actually want to get caught under a blacklight. This 5K weaves through color-designated Blacklight Zones (green, pink, and orange) where runners are blasted with Blacklight Run UV Neon Glow Powder that instantly lights them up! Don’t expect the glow to fade out at the finish line though, because this is where it really pops! A \"Celebration Glow Throw\" of powder is tossed into a crowd dancing under blacklights every 15 minutes during the afterparty. 29. The Slime Run Distance: 5K Location: Various Who didn’t want to get slimed as a kid? More importantly, who doesn’t want to get slimed as an adult? The Slime Run puts runners in slippery situations, in which they have to wiggle through slime-filled tunnels and slosh through slime-filled pits, among other obstacles spread out over a 5K course. Heads up for when you find yourself face down in a puddle of slime—it's edible.

Released as part of a series which has seen him share stories on each and every one of his children, his take on Janet comes as fans anticipate the release of her first studio album since 2008, and five years after the death of her older brother Michael . His words below… Janet, the youngest in the family is very very smart. She was more like a tough kid. She was real rough. I mean she was rough. What do they call them… yes … tomboy. She was a tomboy. She could whop all the girls. Really rough and really really smart. She is really easy nowadays. She has mellowed. She is now married and living a good life with her husband. I always felt that she was a natural when it came to acting. She did that movie, with the late Tupac Shakur. I thought it was a very good movie, and I was very proud of her performance. As great and known as a singer as she is, I think the world has yet to recognize her extremely great talent as an actress that surpasses her singing. She wants to have a good part in a strong action movie. I can’t wait to see her in one. She did surprise me once, picking me as her date to the premiere of the movie she did with Eddie Murphy. Now Eddie is a great friend and I consider him one of this generation’s greatest comedians, but right in the middle of watching the movie, as proud as I was of Janet, I never let her know that. She asked me what I thought and I remember telling her “You should be bigger than this. You should be the lead actor in the movie and carrying it”. I know the comment upset her, because she became quiet and I knew it. But i know her so well, that I knew she was going to channel that anger to prove that she could do better and was right. She came back even stronger with greater movies. And you have not seen the best of her yet. That’s my girl. When I suffered 4 strokes last year, and was in the hospital recovering, only two people in my family traveled all the way to see in the hospital. My granddaughter Brandi (Jackie’s daughter and my baby girl Janet. She sat right next to me as I lay in bed, spent time with me, talking about a lot together. It meant a lot to me.

The naysayers or those baying for his blood may frown on the slipups and blemishes in his movies, point out gaping plot holes, accuse him of opting for remakes rather than original concepts, slam him for using his superstardom for masala entertainers… but you cannot overlook the fact that when Salman saunters on screen, he sets it ablaze with his charm and magnetism. The star-performer carries the weight of the entire film comfortably on his broad shoulders. Everything he does on screen is emulated by his fans pronto: styling, hair style, killer dialogue, dance steps et al. Referred to as 'Bhai' by those close to him, he is now the 'Bhai' or the iconic on-screen characters he has portrayed over the years -- Prem, Radhe, Chulbul Pandey, Lovely Singh, Tiger -- for zillions of fans across the globe. Salman, the star machine, is the Pied Piper of Hindi cinema. He *doesn't* promise path-breaking or art house cinema. The focus is on those three magical words: Entertainment, entertainment and entertainment. And that's what matters to a wide majority of movie-going audience. Sure, the charismatic star's newest outing KICK is a remake of the super-successful Telugu film KICK [2009; directed by Surender Reddy and starring Ravi Teja, Ileana D'Cruz and Shaam]. But there's a world of a difference between KICK, directed by Sajid Nadiadwala, and Salman's last few entertainers. This one's more stylized, has opulence and gloss reeking in every frame and is very international in terms of execution. However, the prime question remains the same: Is KICK Blockbuster material? Yes, of course! The premise of KICK, first! On a train journey in Warsaw, a pretty psychiatrist, Shaina [Jacqueline Fernandez], meets Himanshu [Randeep Hooda], a police officer from India, for an arranged match. They share their pasts with each other. Shaina shares the story of her ex-boyfriend Devi Lal Singh [Salman Khan], a guy who lived only for 'Kick'. She talks about his madness and their whirlwind romance, until one day he breaks up with her for a new kick and walks away, never to return. Himanshu tells her about his glorious escapades and that he has finally met his match -- an intelligent thief. What they don't know is that their stories have one thing in common -- Devil. He returns back into their lives under a new guise of having lost his memory. Behind it all is a deeper mystery and an uncompromising mission… KICK marks Sajid Nadiadwala's rendezvous with direction and though the debutant director may have looked Southwards to choose the story, when it comes to executing the written material, the inspiration is clearly the West: the larger-than-life Hollywood fares. Having produced over a dozen movies till date, Sajid has abundant experience and expertise and knows precisely how to use the familiar tropes to his advantage. Sajid conjures up a world that combines visual brilliance with several knockout episodes. Like Salman, Sajid too has a one-point agenda: Entertainment. No wonder, Sajid and his team of writers ensure that they need to offer more to the astute viewer than what has been witnessed thus far, since the promos have raised the bar and multiplied their expectations. That explains why the cat and mouse game [played between Randeep and Salman] doesn't follow the tried and tested rules, while the conflict between the Samaritan and the antagonist [Salman and Nawazuddin Siddiqui] steers clear of the conventional configuration. As a matter of fact, the frantic twists and turns in the storyline are proof that Sajid and his writing team are keen to offer the audience that extra dose of entertainment which would make KICK a kickass entertainer. KICK has the magnificence [in terms of production values] that was lacking in Salman's previous movies. This is a big ticket movie and Sajid, who has produced larger-than-life extravaganzas in the past, makes sure every frame appears luminous, tasteful and eye-catching. Be it the spectacular locales of Warsaw or the classy sets, the DoP [Ayananka Bose] acts as an aide and encapsulates the plush, up market look with competence. The spectator also gets an international feel during the high-octane stunts, action and chases, which garnish the goings-on magnificently. The train stunt is already the talk of town. Also, the chase in Warsaw, with Salman driving a bus, makes you gasp in disbelief. I'd like to make a special mention of Rajat Aroraa's dialogue. The wordsmith gives the film several clapworthy lines, which are sure to become legendary. The best line is, of course, 'Mere baare mein itna mat sochna, dil mein aata hoon, samajh mein nahin', which comes at a crucial point in the story. The lines delivered by Nawazuddin are super too and the sequence with Salman towards the climax will be greeted with whistles and claps. Take a bow, Rajat! Any hiccups? Yes, of course! The first half could've been tighter. A few sequences have been stretched at times [Salman and Mithun in the bar]. The songs deserved better situations. The romantic track, in the second hour specifically, could've been more persuasive. The soundtrack remains true to the genre of the film and the popularity of 'Jumme Ki Raat' and 'Yaar Na Miley', which appears twice in the film, enhances the overall impact. To state that Salman is the soul of KICK wouldn't be an exaggeration. He's committed, charming and competent, so much so that it's difficult to take your eyes off him. Post DABANGG, those who felt that the actor's movies lacked a cohesive script to match his superstardom, are sure to feel satiated with KICK, since the film has it all and does utmost justice to Salman's aura. In fact, the film gives him the platform to exhibit his range as an actor/star and his real-life role of a good Samaritan/humanitarian further. Rest assured, the fans and the fanatics -- even those who aren't -- are in for a treat! Randeep Hooda is supremely efficient, delivering a performance that stays with you. And this is a huge compliment, since the film is a Salman show from commencement to conclusion. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a powerhouse of talent and KICK gives him the opportunity to cross over to the commercial league. Nawazuddin is simply outstanding, essaying his part with gusto [don't miss his typical laugh, it will definitely catch on big time]. In fact, it won't be erroneous to state that along with Salman, Nawazuddin will walk away with plaudits after KICK. Jacqueline Fernandez does very well, although her diction needs to be worked upon. She looks great and her dance in 'Jumme Ki Raat' is sure to stun you. Mithun Chakraborty is in top form yet again. The sequence with Salman towards the concluding moments stay with you. The supporting cast -- Saurabh Shukla [good], Sanjay Mishra [awesome], Vipin Sharma [super], Archana Puransingh [alright], Kavin Dave [first-rate], Sumona Chakravarti [perfect] -- each of them contribute well to the proceedings. On the whole, KICK is a paisa vasool, seeti-maar entertainer. Get ready for a Tsunami called KICK at the ticket window. It is sure to rewrite box-office records. Salman fans, rejoice. KICK is a sure-shot B-L-O-C-K-B-U-S-T-E-R.

The woman said the rental agreement termination notice came only one day after she complained to the property management company that they were wasting water on the grounds. \"Everyday the sidewalks are flooded. We are in a drought and we need to conserve water. Why would they over water the premises,\" said Debbie Jennings. Jennings said she has lived at the Mill Garden Apartments for 5 years. She said that she's always paid her rent on time and has addressed every issue management was concerned about in the past. \"I believe they are harassing me because I've complained about the water issues,\" said Jennings. Other neighbors that 23ABC spoke with have also seen a huge amount of water waste on the property. Some did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation from management as well. \"They need to fix the sprinklers because I think they water the sidewalk more than the grass. I thought about complaining too, but are they going to try to evict me next,\" said one resident who wanted to remain anonymous. 23ABC contacted 4 Seasons Realty, the property management company. They said they are not attempting to terminate Jennings' contract because of the complaints. Management said that Jennings has violated other issues with her rental agreement, including having other people live there who were not on the lease, but said Jennings had address those issues in the past. According to 4 Seasons officials, by California law, they do not have to give an official reason for terminating a rental agreement, if there is no lease. Jennings said she is happy living at the apartment complex and has spoken to an attorney to fight the rental agreement termination.

The dogs were reportedly running free in the road before the incident and eventually returned to their owner's home. \"It's just crazy to me,\" Smith told the Free Press. \"Animal control should have done something. It should have never gone this far. The fact this has led to a death, it's sickening.\" The dogs have been identified as Cane Corsos, which are a native Italian \"mastiff-type\" dog. They were bred in Italy as a property watchdog and wild boar hunters, according to the American Kennel Club. The pair of dogs, both under 5 years old, were being quarantined at the Lapeer County Animal Shelter, according to the Free Press. Police told the newspaper that the owner brought the dogs in and that authorities will seek to have the animals destroyed if their owner gives up rights to them.

We also offer something for the full time, home business internet marketer who wants to add a primary or additional income stream.

We are here to change that for you and anyone looking for a change. Here are some statistics you’ll find interesting: Every 11 seconds, someone starts a new home based business. Over 70 Million People earn an income in Home Based Internet and Network Marketing and Direct Sales. Sadly, fewer than 5% people in this industry do it full time. And the reason? Because they can’t afford to do it full time.  In the past, there just has not been enough time in the day to work a full time job, care for a family and other obligations and then try to build a side business and create the income needed to quit the job. The reality is, many of the “old methods” of building a leveraged income takes way too long. Calling family and friends; begging people who have no interest to take a look; scheduling home meetings and constantly looking for new people to show your business to – it’s a long, slow, painful process. Not any more! The internet changed everything.

Fashion is a cyclical tale of ever-changing preferences, with trends coming and going as fast as the seasons change—but just as interesting as fashion’s  constantly shifting landscape are the things that do come back. Some trends— ‘90s halter tops , we’re lookin’ at you—are destined to make a resurgence, and are welcomed back into the collective unconscious as part of the modern style lexicon. This story is not about those trends. From trucker hats to giant furry boots, scroll down for 11 trends we hope never come back in style. scroll to see more Back in the Victoria-Era days, women wore corsets so tight that they would often endure damage to their internal organs, broken ribs, and fainting spells. Thanks to women like Coco Chanel, we escaped the bonds that broke us and hopefully will never be forced back into rib-breaking styles of any sort. Try instead: Equally sexy—but infinitely more comfortable—lingerie pieces like bralettes and lace tanks. 1 of 34 Try these styles instead: SHOP Pin Out From Under Longline Triangle Bra Top ($29) Worn under your clothes or as a crop top in its own right, this piece is super chic. 2 of 34 SHOP Pin Free People Lace Cropped Bustier ($38) We love the almost-but-not-quite nude color of this ladylike bustier. 3 of 34 SHOP Pin La Perla Lace and Lycra Bustier ($288) The geometric lace inserts give this piece a very modern edge. Jessica Simpson and Britney Spears were at the forefront of the Daisy Dukes movement, pioneering the belief that undergarment-length denim cutoffs were totally acceptable as “pants.” Try instead: A pair of denim shorts in a flattering cut and length, worn with a crisp white button-up or your favorite flannel. 4 of 34 Try these styles instead: SHOP Pin Frame Denim Le High Short ($189) We love the mid-length on these shorts, and the exposed pockets add just the right amount of distressed appeal. 5 of 34 SHOP Pin J Brand Raw Edged Denim Shorts ($95) The frayed hem on these shorts is not only on-trend , but also quite hip. 6 of 34 SHOP Pin Joe's Jeans Rolled Shorts ($97) Every girl needs a staple set of rolled-hem denim shorts. We’re just going to say it: there is not a woman in the world who looks good in a tube top. At best, they look passable for real clothes—and at worst, they’re bad news bears. Try instead: A billowy silk camisole in a pretty, feminine color—try pairing it with a set of high-waisted trousers or your favorite pencil skirt. 7 of 34 Try these styles instead: SHOP Pin Equipment Cara Camisole ($108) The snakeskin print on this cami makes a statement without going over the top. 8 of 34 SHOP Pin J.Crew Carrie Camisole ($98) The pale blue shade of this cami adds to its already-stellar versatility. 9 of 34 SHOP Pin By Malene Birger Kirah Silk Camisole ($245) Also known as: the cami that can be worn a million ways. These accessories once hit such a popularity peak that rapper Flo Rida wrote a song about them . Fortunately for all of us, a rap song does not a forever shoe icon make. Try instead: A pair of chic Chelsea-style boots in sublte pony hair. 10 of 34 Try these styles instead: SHOP Pin 10 Crosby Derek Lam Charlotte Calf Hair Boots ($450) We love the barely-there cutot detail at the ankle of these boots. 11 of 34 SHOP Pin Rag & Bone Newbury Boot in Black Pony ($595) The stacked heel makes these an easy accessory to dress up for a night out. 12 of 34 SHOP Pin Joie Barlow Booties ($335) The pinpoint print on these boots is just so charming. There was a time when every starlet from Angelina Jolie to Christina Aguilera held up their hip-hugging jeans with belt buckles large enough to double as dinner plates. This is a look only cowboys can successfully pull off. Try instead: A barely-there belt around your natural waist.  13 of 34 Try these styles instead: SHOP Pin Nasty Gal Bar None Belt ($18) The ultra-narrow cut of this belt lends a tremendously dainty vibe. 14 of 34 SHOP Pin Keepsake Wallflower Belt ($50) There's something equally utilitarian and badass about this all-black belt. 15 of 34 SHOP Pin Mango Hook-Fastening Belt ($30) The vintage-inspired hook-and-clasp has us swooning. 16 of 34 SHOP Pin Steven Alan Braided Leather Belt ($38) Every woman needs a great braided leather belt in her collection. Thanks to Britney Spears, insanely low-rise pants had a significant moment in the sun in the mid-2000s. And also thanks to Britney Spears, they quickly faded out. May they never return! Try instead: A pair of high-waisted or mid-rise skinny jeans in a slimming wash. 17 of 34 Try these styles instead: SHOP Pin Frame Denim Le Garcon Distressed Slim Boyfriend Jeans ($250) These jeans achieve the perfect balance between slouchy and skinny. 18 of 34 SHOP Pin Black Orchid High-Rise Skinny Jeans ($140) If you don't have a pair already, you need this pair of high-rise skinnies in a dark wash. We love them with a billowy blouse! 19 of 34 SHOP Pin Saint Laurent High-Rise Skinny Jeans ($595) The vintage high-waist cut of these jeans is impossibly stylish and trés-modern. There’s a reason Carrie Bradshaw railed against these insanely popular hair accessories—unless you’re a five-year-old girl, they tend to make you look a bit too girlish. Try instead: A sleek and grown-up headband, or a vintage designer ponytail tie. 20 of 34 Try these styles instead: SHOP Pin Jennifer Behr Laurel Leaf Headband ($298) How lovely is this dainty gold headband? 21 of 34 SHOP Pin Vintage Chanel CC Ball Hair Tie ($539) This hair tie brings back many childhood memories, with a designer upgrade. 22 of 34 SHOP Pin The Coveted Headband ($48) When it comes to a day-to-day headband, the simpler the better. The ‘80s were almost entirely defined by this blouse style—women took to creating blockier frames for their upper body to emphasize ther waists. Unfortunately, this tactic also made them look like football linebackers. Try instead: A more modern, less blocky version of a boxy blouse.  23 of 34 Try these styles instead: SHOP Pin J Brand Earhart Sheer Stripe Blouse ($202) We love that the stripes on this blouse, from a distance, appear like nothing special — but are actually totally sheer. 24 of 34 SHOP Pin Rachel Comey Allegro Blouse ($345) The fluttering sleeves on this blouse give its boxy shape a feminine touch. 25 of 34 SHOP Pin Mango Linen-Blend Boxy Blouse ($23) This is a great blouse for work  and  play. Now-defunct loungewear brand Juicy Couture built an empire on the popularity of velour tracksuits, which were worn by everyone from Paris Hilton to Kim Kardashian . And hopefully, the velveteen matching sets of days of yore will never return to haunt our dreams. Try instead: A chic and comfortable romper perfect for casual daytime trips to the store and just as easy to dress up for nighttime affairs.  26 of 34 Try these styles instead: SHOP Pin A.L.C. Twisted Drape-Back Sleeveless Jumpsuit ($695) The draping twist at the back of this jumpsuit is the embodiment of elegance. 27 of 34 SHOP Pin Jonathan Simkhai Short Pleat Denim Romper ($198) This romper is a great casual go-to piece — but can also easily be dressed up. 28 of 34 SHOP Pin Topshop Notched Neck Romper ($96) With a pair of statement-making heels, this romper is sure to grab some attention. If a fashion trend’s main arbiter is Ashton Kutcher , you know you’re probably in trouble. Try instead: A classic and comparatively timeless baseball cap in a chic fabrication.  29 of 34 Try these styles instead: SHOP Pin Forever 21 Painter's Baseball Cap ($9) We're usually not much for paint splatter, but we've fallen in love with this cap. 30 of 34 SHOP Pin Free People Goleta Leather Baseball Cap ($58) If you don't already have a black leather baseball cap in your closet, the friendly price of this one should be encouragement enough. 31 of 34 SHOP Pin Stella McCartney Felt-Wool Baseball Cap ($279) We're completely enamored by the shape and fabric of this hat. Believe it or not, there was a time when women wore these on red carpets with heels and sneaker wedges. It was a dark period, and we’d prefet it remain only in our memories. Try instead: A pair of graphic socks worn at a reasonably moderate height, with sleek pumps or your favorite sneakers. 32 of 34 Try these styles instead: SHOP Pin Falke Irregular Cubes Anklet Socks ($13) These cutout socks wold be great under a pair of barely-there sandals, or could even work for a more masculine vibe with loafers. 33 of 34 SHOP Pin Happy Socks Small Dot Socks ($8) When it comes to socks, you basically can't go wrong with polka dots. 34 of 34 SHOP Pin ASOS Multi-Stripe Top Ankle Socks ($6) If you love the athletic-inspired aspect of tall tube socks, these are fantastic alternattive.

Nathan Walker was selected 89 th overall by the Washington Capitals in the 2014 draft and Friday signed a three-year entry-level contract.", "content"=>"It’s just a matter of time before the first Australian drafted by an NHL team gets a chance to play in the big league. Nathan Walker was selected 89 th overall by the Washington Capitals in the 2014 draft and Friday signed a three-year entry-level contract. “He’s probably still a couple of years away, but he’s on the right track,” said Capitals director, amateur scouting Ross Mahoney. “He’s one determined guy, I’ll tell you that. He’s had an incredible journey so far.” Walker, 20, was born in Cardiff, Wales, and was two when his family moved to Sydney, Australia. Though hockey is a bottom rung sport in Australia, Walker became fascinated with the game at the age of six watching Hollywood moves Mystery, Alaska and The Mighty Ducks . As he became a natural playing against older competition, he and his parents realized if he really wanted to pursue the sport, he’d have to take his game elsewhere. In 14 games in an under-14 league, Walker averaged more than seven points per game. His coach at the time had Slovakian connections and was able to get Walker a tryout with the Vitkovice program in the Czech Republic. Central Scouting had him rated for the 2012 draft, but he wasn’t claimed. Mahoney found out about him through Capitals’ European scout Vojtech Kucera. The first time Mahoney saw him play, Walker was playing for the touring Australian national team in a game against Vitkovice, his current team. The Capitals invited Walker to their development camp that summer. “He showed good hockey sense and competitiveness, but we knew he needed improvements in his speed and conditioning,” Mahoney said. Undrafted, Walker moved to North America to play in the United States League with the Youngstown Phantoms in 2012-13, and he averaged almost a point per game. Then this past season, Walker played for the Hershey Bears, Washington’s farm team in the AHL. “We had a very veteran team in Hershey, so Nathan was mostly on the fourth line, but he was also training and learning with professionals,” Mahoney said. The 5-foot-10, 185-pound Walker had just five goals and 11 points in 43 games as a 19-year-old, but showed plenty of promise. The Capitals wanted to make a play for Walker at the 2014 draft, but the 13 th and 39 th picks were too early. Thinking Walker would be gone by the end of the third round, Washington packaged the 104 th and 118 th picks in the fourth round to the New York Rangers for the 89 th pick and drafted Walker. “He was ecstatic when I called him after the draft,” Mahoney said. “He’s such a good person, he’s been working for this for so long. The emotion was pouring out of him.” Will Brodie of the Sydney Morning Herald writes the lack of hockey facilities in Australia has held the game back for generations. But the opening of the Melbourne Icehouse in 2010 has improved the level of play at the national league level. Televised games are attracting fans and sponsors and now this recent achievement by Walker to get drafted by an NHL team will create a following of its own. Walker, who is now fluent in Slovak, Czech and knows some Russian, will be back in Hershey for the next couple of years waiting for his next break and a call-up to the big league. He’ll be the guy with the Australian accent. Said Mahoney: “I still haven’t gotten used to hearing a hockey player say to me, “Hey, mate, how are ya.”   Brian Costello is The Hockey News’s senior editor and  a regular contributor to the thn.com Post-To-Post blog .  For more great profiles, news and views from the world of hockey,  subscribe to The Hockey News magazine .  Follow Brian Costello on Twitter at  @BCostelloTHN", "score"=>163.01378, "summaryTitle"=>"Hey mate, Australian prospect Nathan Walker signs NHL contract", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>["ca", "us"], "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/hey-mate-australian-prospect-nathan-walker-signs-nhl-contract/", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "google.com", "t.co", "direct", "thehockeynews.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1rj1XUi", "lastseen"=>"20140726004338", "page"=>"http://www.thehockeynews.com/blog/hey-mate-australian-prospect-nathan-walker-signs-nhl-contract/"}, {"domain"=>"glamour.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406334642000", "h2"=>["Get Inspired", "Recommended"], "h3"=>["Keywords:", "prev story"], "site"=>"www.glamour.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004558", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335558150", "title"=>"Monique Lhuillier Wedding Dresses, Monique Lhuillier Bliss Wedding Gowns: Glamour.com", "initial"=>"20140726003042", "summaryText"=>"If a white wedding dress doesn’t feel quite right but you don’t want to walk down the aisle in a brightly colored gown, consider one of these seven dresses from Monique Lhuillier ’s Bliss line, all of which have just a hint of color.

After the suspicious photo of Manziel tightly rolling up the bill s urfaced on July 7, Browns coach Mike Pettine called Manziel from his vacation in Hawaii and addressed it, he told cleveland.com on Monday. The conversation was 'positive' but he also planned to talk to Manziel face-to-face when he arrived for the rookie portion of camp on Wednesday. Tightly-rolled bills are typically used to snort cocaine, and the Browns wanted some answers. In fact, NFL chemical dependency consultant and former Browns team physician Dr. Gregory Collins of the Cleveland Clinic told cleveland.com that such a photo would warrant a league inquiry and drug test to make sure the player is okay, even though it's not proof of use. But it's not just that photo that has the Browns dismayed, the sources said. Manziel regressed in practice after the first week of organized team activities, and some in the organization attributed it to too much jet-setting and not enough dedication to the playbook. Team officials had bought into Manziel's pre-draft promises to tone down the partying and leave his frat-boy lifestyle back in College Station, Texas, and they've been stunned by his non-stop antics, sources said. Since they traded up to draft him No. 1 overall on May 8, he's partied hard in New York City, Las Vegas twice, Los Angeles with hip-star Drake, Austin, Tex., Houston, Tex. and at pop star Justin Bieber's house in Beverly Hills with the likes of world champ Floyd Mayweather. The romp across the country -- complete with photos of him drinking magnums of champagne and spraying it around clubs -- has been completely opposite of what Manziel told the Browns during his private workout for them at Texas A&M and during his pre-draft visit to Cleveland. It's also been contrary to what he said publicly in the months leading up to the draft and after the Browns traded up to No. 22 to select him.   In an interview with John McLain of the Houston Chronicle in February, Manziel vowed to shed his Johnny Football personna and TMZ lifestyle . \"I was a kid who made some goofball decisions,\" he said. \"That's been part of my journey. Maybe it's part of the whole Johnny Football deal that I'm trying to get away from. I'm trying to show people I've grown up and I've learned from my experiences. I feel like you're a stupid person if you continue to make the same wrong decisions. I don't want to hear, 'Oh, anybody in his situation would have been doing the same thing.' I'm 100 percent responsible for my actions.\" He also said, \"Johnny Football is the stuff you see on TMZ. There's part of that folktale that goes along with it and tries to twist me into somebody I'm not all the time. I feel like now there's kind of like this frozen food package - a prewrapped, precooked package of who I am. \"Johnny Manziel is the guy that - whether it's Houston, Jacksonville, Cleveland or Oakland - you'll have to drag off that field before I stop playing for those guys. Those are my teammates. Those are my brothers from now on. I'm going to fight until there's no time left on the clock. That's Johnny Manziel.'' That's the Johnny Manziel the Browns thought they were getting, the one that seemed to grow up before the world's eyes in the months leading up to the draft. Manziel's agent, Erik Burkhardt, shielded him from  the spotlight during the pre-draft process, keeping him away from the Super Bowl festivities in New York City and sharply limiting his interviews. Meanwhile, Manziel spent his days and nights working out with quarterback guru and Massillon native George Whitfield in San Diego, where Whitfield honed his skills and improved his pocket presence considerably. At his Pro Day at Texas A&M, Manziel re-iterated that he was a new man, dedicated to becoming a Super Bowl-winnning quarterback. \"I just want to let these guys know that my focus is football. This is my life. This is what I love to do. I've never been more dedicated and committed in my entire life. I'm so excited. I understand the challenge and the jump. There's no denying that,'' he told NFL Network. \"I want to be one of those (stars) one day. ...whether it's Peyton Manning, whether it's Tom Brady, I see what it takes for them to be great. You have to be dedicated to it 100 percent that way.'' And on draft weekend, Manziel vowed to keep his promise. \"I know I need to put all my time right now into maintaing my life in football and trying to be as good of a quarterback as possible,'' he said. \"Everything else is extra and really there's no time for that now. I'm very committed to expanding my knowledge of the game and getting better as a quarterback. That's my focus right now.'' Two weeks later, he boarded a plane for Vegas over Memorial Day Weekend and the perpetual bachelor party was on. Pettine remained unfazed through most of the twitter and Instagram posts, the inflatable swans, the money phones and the Bieber blowout, but became concerned -- along with everyone else in the organization -- when the bill-rolling photo landed. In addition to calling Manziel, Pettine got on the horn with some of Manziel's college coaches and was assured he'd buckle down once camp started. \"I know as committed he is to football, once the season starts, it should not be an issue,'' Pettine said. \"People who know him have said it will stop.'' Impact on the quarterback competition But as this week has worn on, Pettine seems to have changed his tune on the quarterback competition. On Monday, he told cleveland.com that although Brian Hoyer is starting out No. 1 on the depth chart, he views the competition \"as open'' and vowed to give  Hoyer and Manziel reps with \"the same supporting cast'' to make it as fair and even as possible. By Wednesday afternoon, after meeting with offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan and quarterbacks coach Dowell Loggains, Pettine told a second wave of reporters in one-on-one interviews that Manziel wouldn't be getting reps with the first team offense during the early days of training camp, which begins Saturday. \"Well, they're going to compete, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to take equal time with the ones, \" Pettine told The Chronicle-Telegram. \"Brian is the starting quarterback right now, we can still evaluate Johnny's reps regardless of who he's out there with. I think a lot will be made of, wait a minute, he hasn't been with the (ones). To me, it's something that we can still evaluate, give him a specific grade based on his footwork, how he called the play, what he read during that play — all the stuff that's in his control. \"It doesn't matter what group he's with, he's still getting graded. That'll be a big part of the evaluation, it won't be how he did when he was necessarily with a certain group.\" Pettine, who will name his starter before the third preseason game Aug. 23, also cautioned that it will be tough for Manziel beat out Hoyer for the starting job. \"I would say it's a tall task, for a couple reasons,\" Pettine said. \"One, he's a rookie coming in learning the system. It's not like (Miami's Ryan) Tannehill, who came in running his college system. He's learning something that's completely new to him, so he's got all new verbiage and reads and that type of thing working against him. \"And then the guy he's competing with is an NFL veteran who's learned from one of the best in the game, who's very prepared, very focused. It's a very true statement, it will be difficult.\" Indeed, Hoyer, who's coming off a torn anterior cruciate ligament, has taken only five days off since returning from his October surgery and is determined to stave off the Heisman Trophy winner, who made a bold proclamation to the Houston Chronicle in February. \"People can call me crazy, and it's not cockiness, (but) I'm going to put myself in (position) to win the Super Bowl every single year,\" Manziel said. \"A 5-10 guy (Russell Wilson) just won the Super Bowl in his second year in the NFL. That's unreal. I want to be the first rookie to win the Super Bowl.\" Other sources have said it's still truly an open competition and no one knows how it will play out yet, in part because the club hasn't yet seen Hoyer operate in the new offense in 11-on-11s yet. However, he's been cleared for full action in camp, and the Browns want him to start catching up right away. Don't bet against Manziel A source close to Manziel said he's been working hard behind the scenes, bulking up some and even going back out to San Diego to work with Whitfield, who was recently hired as an assistant coach with the 49ers. \"People said all of this stuff about Johnny after he won the Heisman as a freshman, that he was out partying too much,'' said the source. \"But he came back even stronger his second year and arguably played better against Alabama and other teams as a sophomore. He'll come into camp with the right mindset -- to be better tomorrow than he is today.'' The source said Manziel made huge strides from his first year to second year at Texas A&M and \"he's got to be out there doing something right when the whole world's not watching to make those types of improvements. There are no stories around the weight room. The stories are when he's out with a rock star. Whitfield, who's no longer allowed to speak at length about Manziel because he works for the 49ers, would at least allow that learning from Hoyer will be the best thing that happens to Manziel. \"Brian Hoyer is going to have a very big impact on Johnny learning how to be a professional,'' said Whitfield. \"He's a blue-chip quarterback. Everything Johnny needs to learn from a true professional is there in Brian and Johnny's talked about that. He's learned from him already and what kind of example he sets. Every day he gets to go to work with and sit next to a guy that's done it in Brian.'' Sources said Manziel looked sharp on his first day of practice Thursday and had a good grasp of the plays being run, a sign that he's had his nose in the playbook. \"People will see how hard Johnny works once this thing gets rolling,'' said a source. \"He'll get more mature as he goes along.

Well, that is what those who see Nigeria through the lens of the 2015 elections want us to believe. There are many things wrong with politics and politicians in Nigeria but General Buhari is well and truly above that. Even his opponents admit he is well and truly above board when it comes to the shame and corruption that accompany Nigerian politics. There was clearly a suicide bomber and the bomber was obviously desperate to ensure the retired General was part of his eventual carnage. The incident has since happened, scores have died and Nigerians in their usual way have moved on. Had we lost the General, the reaction from his supporters and fanatics could easily have plunged Nigeria into its worst chaos in a long time. We have a problem on our hands as terrorists continue not just to maim and kill but to set us against one another. Following each terrorist attack are the accusations and counter accusations. “They know only Igbos sell in that market, so they chose that market to bomb of all places in the north,” is a classic response from a bomb blast that ripped through Kano in northern Nigeria. It did not matter to the person who wrote the words that there is no way anyone would bomb a public place in Kano and not kill more northerners. Even if we took for granted that only a particular ethnic group sells wares in a selected Kano market, should we also assume all the customers and buyers are from the same place? When bombs go off in a church, you are likely to read, “this people are only killing Christians, it is a war against Christians.” You are not likely to read anything from such people when a Mosque gets attacked or when the insurgents kill a revered Islamic scholar. Those who see the world through their bias often times do not see it through the eyes of logic. So they are not likely to remember than bombs are not capable of separating people into ethnic or religious groups, bombs kill and maim everyone within the radius of impact. That is the same logic to apply when someone like General Buhari survives a major attack that had his vehicles destroyed. That if the terrorists could strike right at a point where one of the nation’s could easily have been killed, they can get anyone. If they missed a major Islamic cleric by a matter of minutes and have killed some other ones, they certainly do not discriminate in terms of their intent; they want to kill anyone not open supportive of their evil and they are not afraid to go after high profile targets just as they kill the poor every other day if not everyday in the northeast. We need a bi-partisan approach to the war on terror. We are of course not likely to get it soon if someone as highly involved as the minister of state could share an article link claiming one of the major opposition parties is supportive of Boko Haram. This is despite the fact that Boko Haram predates the party by at least 10 years. How can we have a bi-partisan approach to this war if politicians across the board insist on making this more about the 2015 elections than about what it is; a war on our country, our people and our way of life? And if politicians insist on making it political all the time, what is the role of citizens and civil society? If the numbers get crunched, Nigeria’s poor masses have suffered a lot more in the hands of terrorism. The least we can do is to stop echoing the voices of those who insist on making this about politics and nothing else.", "score"=>162.82692, "summaryTitle"=>"So, General Buhari tried to kill himself?", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>["ng-05-lagos", "ng-31-abuja"], "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.myopinion.ng/so-general-buhari-tried-to-kill-himself/", "referrer"=>["dlvr.it", "direct", "aol.com", "myp.pw", "twitter.com", "t.co", "facebook.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1noKpXL", "lastseen"=>"20140726003206", "page"=>"http://www.myopinion.ng/so-general-buhari-tried-to-kill-himself/", "ogtitle"=>["So, General Buhari tried to kill himself?", "So, General Buhari tried to kill himself?"]}, {"domain"=>"twistmagazine.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406326221000", "h3"=>["More Stories Like This", "How old are you?"], "site"=>"www.twistmagazine.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004432", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335472399", "title"=>"Is This Iggy Azalea's Fanciest Fashion Gig Ever? | Twist", "initial"=>"20140725221021", "summaryText"=>"We already know that Iggy Azalea is extremely fancy, but now she has got a seriously cool new fashion gig to brag about: The hip hop star will be hosting the new season of MTV's House of Style starting on August 4!

This weekend, more than a dozen of his classmates will hold a fundraiser to help his family with medical bills. \"He's super funny and nice,\" Kate Sargent said. Witnesses say Angel Stevens pushed Skyler Burchardi out of harm's way as a van came speeding through a car show on Cliff Avenue on July 13. Before she died, Stevens is credited with saving the 13-year-old boy's life.  \"We were all just very shocked,\" Lexi Herr said. \"I was just really sad for him,\" Sargent said. Burchardi did get hurt and spent time in the hospital, healing from a broken pelvis, jaw and concussion. Soon, his friends from middle school had an idea. \"We knew that the medical bills will be pretty high,\" Sargent said. \"We wanted to raise money to help his family so he could get better.\" Kate Sargent and Lexi Herr began messaging their friends. A group of more than a dozen will be washing cars for free-will donations Saturday. They don't have a clue how much money they can raise, but say all of the money will go to Burchardi. \"It's actually like a good feeling to help because I think he's going to be very happy, and his family will be,\" Herr said. \"Anything will help him, any amount, any amount of people that come, anything will help,\" Sargent said.

The woman was identified as Andrea Miller, 28, from Long Beach. The male suspect was identified as Gus Adams, 26, of Long Beach. Adams was booked into jail on a robbery and murder charge, Long Beach police said in a press release.

Even though the woman was running away, Greer said he regards what he did as self-defense. He said he arrived at home Tuesday night to find a couple in the middle of a late-night break-in when they attacked him. \"When I went in there, they tackled me,\" Greer told NBC4. \"Both of them jumped up on top of me.\" At one point, Miller stopped hitting Greer to help Adams break into a safe, police said. While the suspects ransacked his home, Greer got his gun from another room, returned to confront them and fired his gun while they were still inside his house, police said. Both suspects ran out, making off with items taken during the burglary. Greer followed them as they ran out and fired again. Miller was struck by gunfire, fell in the alley, and died, authorities said. Adams got away, but was captured later. The surviving suspect was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of residential burglary and murder, McDonnell said. The murder charge, which will be considered by the district attorney, is possible because Adams is accused of being involved in a felony that led to a death, McDonnell said.  It was not immediately clear whether Adams hired an attorney. Greer told detectives he believes the suspects broke into his home and stole cash and property three times before, police said. Greer's estranged wife, Dorothy, said on Thursday one of the burglaries happened while she was at home. She saw her jewelry stolen. But she never expected such violence. \"It's scary,\" she said. \"Either way it goes, it's scary.

That car is the Stone Brothers Racing #9 Caltex Havoline Falcon AU (chassis AU3) driven by David Besnard and Simon Wills to a thrilling victory in the 2002 Queensland 500. Back then, the Ipswich venue played host to the traditional 500-kilometre, pre-Bathurst endurance race, though 2002 would be the last time it hosted it. SBR benefited from its home track advantage and Besnard qualified fourth with teammate Marcos Ambrose on pole. The Caltex Ford was in the hunt throughout the 161-lap race, and during the closing stages Besnard was running second and making inroads on the Kmart Commodore of Greg Murphy, which was in doubt to reach the finish on low fuel. The Safety Car was called on lap 155 for Steve Owen’s CAT Falcon beached in the Turn 1 sandtrap, leaving a three-lap sprint to the flag. Murphy spluttered out of Turn 3 on the penultimate lap, Besnard pounced and the green Falcon took the race win – the first and only for our featured car, the first for Besnard and Wills and the first Ford win of 2002 that broke a streak of 12 round wins for Holden dating back to the previous season. It was also the car’s last race in the hands of SBR, who ran the car over three seasons. The #9 Falcon started life as Tony Longhurst’s Caltex Havoline car for the 2000 season. Longhurst debuted the car at Phillip Island and raced it all season, being joined by Besnard for the enduros at Ipswich and Bathurst. This car came agonisingly close to winning at Bathurst that year, even despite making more pit stops than anyone else and even having a flash fire during a pit stop! But just 10 laps from the finish, Longhurst clashed with Adam Macrow (driving John Faulkner’s Asia Online Commodore) on the approach to Forrest’s Elbow, damaging the Ford’s front suspension and putting it out of the race. Besnard’s impressive performances in the enduros and a limited Dunlop Series (then known as the Konica V8 Lites) campaign saw him replace Longhurst for the following season in our featured car. The highly rated rookie had a tough season, finishing 23rd overall in the points and driving AU3 all season. Matthew White co-drove for the endurance races. Besnard drove the car again in 2002 at all rounds up to the Queensland 500 before teaming with Wayne Gardner at Bathurst in the car Gardner had made a handful of appearances in that year. It was crashed with Gardner at the wheel in practice, meaning a new car was built up in time for Besnard for the Gold Coast – three different cars for him in three successive rounds surely must be a record! Mundy’s first race in AU3 was the non-championship Dunlop Series race at Bathurst. The car was prepared by Paul Cruickshank Racing and backed by Actron Air. Mundy drove the car for the full Dunlop Series seasons in both 2003 and 2004 and it lay unraced in PCR’s workshops in 2005 until Terry Wyhoon purchased it. Wyhoon ran the car in both the Touring Car Challenge and the Dunlop Series in 2006 and actually won the reverse grid race at Wakefield Park. Kiwi Paul Kelly, who later raced Porsche Carrera Cup in Australia, drove it at Queensland Raceway before Wyhoon completed the season in this car. Wyhoon’s Image Racing team retained it for 2007, with Wyhoon starting the season in it before Owen Kelly was set to step in at Queensland Raceway. After the first practice session, things took a very dramatic turn. There had been a disagreement about who actually owned the car prior to Wyhoon purchasing it. Police appeared at the circuit, the car was towed from Queensland Raceway and impounded – mid race meeting! It was eventually returned to Wyhoon and the former NASCAR/AUSCAR driver campaigned it for the remainder of the season. Taz Douglas spent some time racing it in the 2008 DVS before Wyhoon stepped back in for the Winton round – the car’s last start in V8 Supercar competition. But it found another home in the Kumho V8 Touring Car Series on the Shannons Nationals schedule with Wyhoon racing it in 2009 before it was sold to its current owner Stuart Inwood in 2011. He appeared briefly in the V8 Touring Car Series before concentrating his racing on state level Sports Sedan competition in New South Wales. The SBR-built Ford was advertised for sale in 2012 and returned to its Caltex #9 livery as run by Besnard. Sharp-eyed V8 Supercars fans will have noticed the car in action to this year’s Winton 400 V8 Supercars Championship event, where Inwood raced the re-liveried Caltex machine in the Sports Sedan support category. Inwood’s AU is a great example of numerous V8 Supercars which have been brought back to their former liveries and specification in recent years, to be run in other categories, historic events or displayed around the country for fans to enjoy.

But it wasn’t billed that way by either company. Instead the press release read “HP and Hortonworks Deepen Relationship focused on Enterprise Hadoop.” The reason it was framed that way is pretty simple: HP needs a powerful data engine for HAVEn, its “open” big data architecture that incorporates Hadoop, Autonomy, Vertica, Enterprise security and a number of apps that can be built on the platform. As part of the relationship, Vertica will soon be certified by Hortonworks as YARN-ready. YARN is a key component of Apache Hadoop 2. Hortonworks, for its part, wants to spread and wed its flavor of completely Open Source Hadoop as widely and as deeply as possible, and being closely integrated into HP’s popular analytics stack, as well as some of its other offerings, is a good way to do that. But that’s not all.   Sweetening the Deal In order to remain relevant in computing’s third era, HP needs to be able to offer unparalleled Hadoop oriented products and services to its customers. For that to happen, HP has to either develop best in class expertise in-house (and HP doesn’t employ any Hadoop committers ) or to partner closely with someone who can provide it. And Hortonworks is an extremely strong choice for the latter. Not only does the company employ more Hadoop committers than any other vendor, but one of its co-founders, Arun Murthy, is sometimes referred to as the “father” of Apache Hadoop 2 which includes game-changing YARN. What a partnership like this means to HP is access to Hortonworks engineers who will work side-by-side with HP engineers building products, and training on Hortonworks’ Enterprise Hadoop platform (HDP) which it will support for its customers. In such a model, Hortonworks promises to have its business partners’ backs should they encounter problems they can’t solve on their own. Not only that, but Hortonworks also says that it won’t compete with its business partners for customers. Happily Ever After Isn't Just for Fairy Tales While all of this might seem like pretty, ideological talk, Hortonworks has already demonstrated that it walks the walk — it works this way with SAP, Teradata, Microsoft and even HP, though the latter relationship will now be strengthened. There’s something other than money and a reinforced commitment that Hortonworks wins from HP as well: namely the guidance of its CTO, Martin Fink. Fink, who will become a member of Hortonworks’ board, also directs HP Labs, the company’s exploratory and advanced research group which is responsible for anticipating IT trends to address the complex issues that will face HP customers and society over the next decades. He may be invaluable in providing insight into the future. That’s not all: Fink is also a huge proponent of Open Source Linux which he brought into a proprietary HP years ago. That makes him well equipped to offer sage advice based not in theory but on lessons learned. So while HP’s $50 million should go a long way in helping Hortonworks hire more salespeople and broaden its footprint, the HP Hortonworks relationship offers each company something more which could have just as much impact and be longer lasting.

On the right column, write How and Why. Then, go to any news site — local, national, or global — or even to a print newspaper and see which questions the stories you see answer. At most news sites, the hashmarks will fill up quickly in the left column — slowly, if at all, in the right one. That’s the column for explanatory journalism — the new craze of the past year, but built on ideas as old as good journalism itself. Or call it the Wonk Wars as Capital New York and The Huffington Post , among others, have called it. The stories don’t have to be headlined “Why” or “How” (although they often are, as in Upshot’s  “Why Democrats Have a Shot in Georgia,” FiveThirtyEight’s “How a Woman’s Weight Before Pregnancy Affects Childbirth,”  and Vox’s “How Israel decides to go to war,” In explaining, though, they have to go beyond the facts that are well reported in other places. How do we explain this movement, which this week got a new competitor with The Washington Post’s Storyline? I spoke recently with David Leonhardt , who heads The New York Times’ three-month-old The Upshot about that. (Leonhardt won a well-deserved Pulitzer in 2011 for his economic commentary; I still remember how his unusually clear and candid dispatches from the depth of economic catastrophe differentiated themselves from what else was out there.) One big reason, he said, is the explosion of easily available data. Another: the more conversational tone of the Internet. You can take more complicated events and explain them in a conversational way. Leonhardt says he trained himself to be a plain-speaking columnist by writing his drafts in Yahoo Mail for months, skipping the formality of Microsoft Word. Explainer journalism derives from knowledge — and from ignorance. “Our authority comes from knowing what we do and don’t know,” Leonhardt says. It also lets readers know “we’re trying to think it through.” Explainer journalism assumes a certain curiosity and appetite among intelligent readers — and that alone is worth understanding. All this investment in explainers can be so confusing ( “The newsonomics of why everyone seems to be starting a new site” ). It’s got its war metaphors, but they’re misplaced. It’s got its data true believers — seeing Nate Silver hold a group of many hundreds of techies in semi-thrall in Austin at SXSW is more than a bit amusing. In fact, though, this movement isn’t one to take lightly or categorize or mistake. It’s a movement into the next phase of digital journalism, one that recognizes our best selves — and could provide a better business route forward. And at a time when robots are learning how to do some basic journalistic tasks , it might provide a route to future employment. Leonhardt’s staff is profoundly digital — one of the leading edges of the Times’ transformation. Upshot pieces do run in the paper, about one a day, but that’s only a small part of The Upshot’s production. With a half dozen pieces a day and lots of interactives, Upshot is a digital-first operation. Rather than spending time tweaking or crafting a story to fit within the space boundaries and story conventions of print, The Upshot can write long or short. It can use stories in the paper to point to its highly popular interactives (see the middle of the page here ) — and in that we see the swivel-chair movement of hybrid print/digital readers that’s a vital part of news business strategy today. The Times traded one Nate (Silver) for another one ( Cohn , from The New Republic). He’s one of a staff of 17. Those people are a picture of how more integrated news teams, using the best skills of the day, will increasingly be organized: editors, reporters, data people, and three full-time designers, the latter both responding to others’ story ideas and originating their own. The Upshot has recruited 10 outside contributors, experts and academics — like historian Michael Beschloss, who writes History Source , and political science Lynn Vavreck . Finally, The Upshot can call on wider ring of non-Upshot Timesmen and Timeswomen; Leonhardt figures about 25 to 30 Times journalists overall have contributed to The Upshot. It may seem kind of funny, in 2014, that we’re talking amongst ourselves about what exactly explanatory journalism is — or how it might be different from regular, adjective-free journalism itself. That may be the opportunity. At their best, these explainer sites are much more than a fad or a trend. They are a siren call to add greater intelligence to the journalism we do day in and day out. Ask a reader what they want out of their news and they’d say: Tell me what’s happening. Probing a little more, we might hear: Tell us what the real story is. So it’s not surprising that Washington Post Storyline editor Jim Tankersley opens his introduction with: “This is a storytelling site, so let’s start with a story.” His further explanation of explainer journalism is right on, but it also poses a big question to the craft: Isn’t storytelling what we’re supposed to be doing? Isn’t that what readers expect? I don’t mean novelistic imagery and lots of scene-setting, though that’s often welcome — just simply telling us what the story really is, as far as we know it. Leonhardt makes the point that such journalism is far from new and isn’t limited to the new set of sites. He’s a fan of both Silver and Klein and points to long-time explainers-without-portfolio who have been doing this work for a long time: The New Yorker’s Jim Surowiecki, The Wall Street Journal’s David Wessel, The Washington Post’s Steve Pearlstein, and Felix Salmon, formerly of Reuters and now at Fusion. It’s no accident those are mainly business writers; that’s Leonhardt’s own background. The complexity of business and economics demands better connecting of the dots. But so does so much of the rest of the news. (The Upshot, for instance, has already excelled at covering health care — and the World Cup.) It’s this class of complicated how-and-why questions that we all need to understand. There are huge, hairy issues everywhere: immigration, climate change, economic inequality, health care, education. These are global, national, and local issues. Tankersley has explained that Storyline is about the nexus of people and policy. That sums it up well — and, again, should be what news stories are doing everyday. That’s journalism’s contribution to democracy, at least when it’s well done. It’s not “extra.” Tankersley is among the numerous journalists who know that. Maybe “explainer” or “storytelling” journalism will help reawaken newsrooms and news people to that basic mandate. How did we find ourselves in a world where there are two kinds of “stories”? The first kind, apparently, disgorges facts. That’s the kind you’ll probably find a Google News search. Google News — still a laundry list of a product — specializes in the Who/What/When/Where. It’s all there in glorious repetition, its only hierarchy imperceptible to humans and a comfort to some algorithms somewhere. That’s what algorithms, without human leadership and curation, will get you today. Where’s our How and Why news search engine? Then there are the stories, old school and new explainer school, that tell us how the facts fit together. Of course, at top-drawer publications like the Post and the Times, these aren’t really two separate kinds. Some of what both do every day is explainer journalism — but they haven’t always explained that well to themselves or their readers. The Upshot and Storyline, then, force the issue more widely, asking basic craft questions about the kind of journalism that should be produced today. Curiously, I think the readers are ahead of the journalists. What’s the difference between the reborn, digital-embracing, globe-reaching New York Times and the rest of America’s (local) press? It’s not mainly business model, or even reach: It’s authority. You read the Times to understand. Sometimes it does a better job of that than others, but its great success in reader revenue shows us its audience gets that part of the value equation. Yes, readers can get the facts of the Gaza War free in so many places, but they can’t get a volume of rich, contextual stories from both sides of the conflict elsewhere every day. Key to the connect-the-dots phenomenon: the death of the traditional news cycle. The Internet has obliterated second-day stories and third-day “analysis” pieces, eating them before lunch each day. It’s largely made mincemeat of weekly commentary sections and newsmagazines which tried to make sense of the week that had been. If second-day stories are gone, then first-day stories have joined them. Today, readers expect as much understanding within the news of the day, as soon as journalists can crank it out. Newspaper — in print or online — can no longer get away with headlines like “Airliner shot down over Ukraine” 18 hours after the news blitzed smartphones and social feeds everywhere. And yet, more than few did just that. First- and second-day stories should now be artifacts of another civilization. Yes, this bit of creative destruction has also created hamster-wheel operations, intended to get any set of facts out first and to pump ever more news content onto the web. At the same time, it’s pushed the best journalists to connect the dots more quickly. When most readers say they expect journalists to tell them what’s happening — whether that’s the latest outrages reported out of Kharkiv or city council in Kalamazoo — they mean connect the dots. No, they don’t want opinion — they want to know how the facts fit together to make an understandable whole. Those Kalamazoo readers — like many in the vast reaches of America who depend on local newspaper companies to deliver their news — have heard very little about “explainer journalism.” There’s an increasing divide between national/global journalism and local journalism. Digital business models overvalue national/global and greatly undervalue local. Local newspaper staffing in the U.S. is off 30 percent, or about 18,000 people. But beyond that, several hundred thousand years of local knowledge have been lost at the same time. Let’s say the average laid off/bought out journalist had 12 years of experience; that would be a cumulative loss of about 216,000 years of local knowledge. Local daily newspapers have traditionally been disproportionately in the Who/What/When/Where column, but some of that now-lost local knowledge edged its ways into How/Why stories, or at least How/Why explanations within stories. Understanding of local policy and local news players has been lost; lots of local b.s. detection has vanished almost overnight. The best local columnists often told readers what was really happening, given their real community knowledge and their ability to offer voice. Now many of them have been shown the door, higher-priced casualties of an industry that has largely chosen to cut its way to continued profitability rather than invest in its future. So most local papers, as I’ve seen them, aren’t even players in the wonk wars. They are connecting fewer dots, rather than more, even as our sense that readers want more is growing. At a local news level, less and less is explained to us. Given cutbacks, many newspaper publishers and editors have elected to go wide rather than deep. I see that in my local Santa Cruz Sentinel , a Digital First Media-owned paper (for now, at least). It’s an above-average daily, winning scads of awards. Its coverage of the county’s long-term water problems, among a couple of other topics, has been superior and dot-connecting. Day in and day out, though, its hard-working reporters go wide, and the result is too often single- or couple-source stories that mystify rather than enlighten. The Sentinel, to be sure, provides a unique and valuable service every day — building a data bank of happenings. Even as I try to convince friends to subscribe, I often find I need a decoder ring to make sense of a story. In Wednesday’s edition, perhaps one story could be considered an “explainer.” To be clear, I’m not asking that all stories be explainers — just more, the ones that require it. Which brings us back to business argument. If, in fact, in a world awash in Who/What/When/Where, readers value the connecting of dots, they’re more likely to pay for it — and to pay more for it. That’s the business rationale for the Upshots and Storylines. The New York Times now depends on its readers for most of its revenues; satisfy those readers more deeply, with understanding, and they’re less likely to cancel subscriptions and more likely to pay more each year. The Post, too, knows that explainer journalism — part of its bigger national play — is a key part of its value proposition to readers. Bonus: Smart, well-tweeted, well-shared Upshots and Storylines burnish the larger brand, and that helps sell premium-priced advertising. (A check of the Times’ most shared stories often finds Upshot pieces among the top 20.) For the Voxes and FiveThirtyEights, the business rationale shares the brand- and audience-building elements, but it lackes that critical reader-revenue component — so far, at least. If we define “explainer journalism” too narrowly — just naming Vox, FiveThirtyEight, The Upshot, and Storyline — we miss the point. The new wave doesn’t define it. The new wave reawakens our appreciation of it. The Wall Street Journal, the FT,  The Economist, and The New Yorker are just a few of the news outfits that have long based their products on making the world a little more understandable for their readers. More recently, sites as far-flung as Quartz and the Netherlands’ De Correspondent have joined that group. What they have in common: the ability to price up for readers, or charge premium rates to advertisers, or both. Might they be on to something? If explainer journalism really can up the intelligence quotient among it readers and get more of them to pay for digital news (take note: Pew, Knight, grad students in search of dissertation topics), then how does more of the local press can get there? That’s a big mountain. It’s hard to regain the lost knowledge already excised from newsrooms. Some of the younger, less well-paid staff hired as replacements have the ability to do the work — but they need to both be led and allowed to do it. The trade needs a Watergate-like makeover, one that would encourage the smartest people with the best storytelling-like skills to be come into it and to stay. That’s a matter of both money and culture. I asked David Leonhardt about bringing Upshot-like craft to the regional/local press. “You don’t need 17 people to do it,” he said. “You can do it with three people.” From his lips to local reader’s eyes.

It takes a little experimenting to come up with your own ride or die, holy grail mix, but once you do, the difference it makes could mean a few extra inches of retained length per year. Here are some of my favorite, personal oil mixes and how I use them to achieve maximum length retention. Brilliant Sealant This recipe contains some of my favorite mix of oils for shine, anti-frizz and moisture. It also has impressive occlusive properties similar to a silicone oil mix except there’s no silicone in it. Castor oil is a rather unique oil, boasting of unique fatty acids and similar “humectant” qualities of the well known vegetable glycerin . With a base of castor oil and the oil/wax like characteristics of jojoba that mimics our own scalp’s sebum, you’re bound to experience an intense moisture, making for an amazing length retaining potion. In a small glass bowl mix the following oils. 1oz   castor oil 1 oz jojoba oil ½ oz grapeseed oil ½ oz vegetable oil (yes. Vegetable oil) Stir until they appear to be a homogenous mix. I use this oil mix immediately after washing my hair and follow up with a leave in. It’s done wonders with keeping my hair moisturized for a good week. I also use it on my baby girl’s hair and find that her hair stays soft for days. Amla Be Rich Amla oil is produced from a combination of the fruit  (amla aka gooseberry) with any base oil or butter.  Amla’s pH is perfect for reviving your curl and helping to calm a scalp issue. Combined with ultra fatty oils it can really boost your moisture retention, which eventually spells L-E-N-G-T-H for your strands. In a small pot, combine these ingredients on low heat. 4 oz cocoa butter 2 oz coconut oil 2 oz   almond oil 2 tbs amla powder (dried amla fruit) Stir mix while on low heat. Remove from heat after 15 or so minutes. To get a really rich infusion, leave the amla in the oil overnight or for a week. Strain the amla powder with cheesecloth. I use amla enriched cocoa butter and coconut oil as an extra luxurious hot oil treatment. Leave it on your hair for as long as you wish. I get the best results on freshly washed or clarified hair. Check out my how to video here . Ditch Your Itch I’m convinced that poor scalp health can halt any “long hair don’t care” aspirations of most naturalistas and this particular oil mix right here has been used by so many of my clients and friends to help with their scalp situations.  I recommend seeing a dermatologist about on going scalp issues and even though I’ve had no adverse reactions from using the oils in this recipe, they are strong so experiment at home at your own risk. The base oil of this mix is neem oil . Neem oil is a natural anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-septic, anti-viral, and anti-bug (such as lice) remedy. It’s also uber potent so if you’re pregnant or trying to get pregnant consult your doctor about using it topically. When you combine this oil with rosemary essential oil , you get a very powerful (albeit, also very stinky) oil mix for your scalp. Combine in a glass bowl 2 oz organic neem oil 6-8 drops rosemary essential oil Neem doesn’t sting at all, and it feels like a very fatty type oil (kind’ve like olive oil ), but you should do a little skin test on a hidden part of your body just to make sure you won’t have any adverse reaction to this potent mix at least 24 hours before applying a few drops to you scalp. You can also dilute the neem oil with another oil (1:5 ratio). I strongly recommend diluting it if you already know you have sensitive skin. Once you’ve established that you won’t break out in strange hives from it, apply just a few drops to the troubled areas on your scalp. Massage it in and let it sit for an hour or so. Rinse it off with a water and apple cider vinegar mix or follow up with an anti-itch or anti-dandruff shampoo.  Do this weekly for a few weeks.

Podolski’s future during the second half of last season was uncertain. The German forward was out of the side after returning from injury, with Arsene Wenger regularly overlooking the 29-year-old, even as an option from the bench. A move back to Germany was mooted, with Schalke said to be interested. But off the back of a World Cup win, where, admittedly, Podolski was again a peripheral figure, and now a sharp upturn in positive feeling around Arsenal, Wenger may just be preparing to hang on to the forward, who has developed a notable cult following among supporters. Podolski is good for the dressing room too, where his mood never seems to waver, even amid struggles for regular football. And make no mistake, the Polish-born German international isn’t just a lovable mascot, he’s the most clinical finisher at the club, even after the signing of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona. He may not tick the boxes Wenger deems necessary to play as a lone striker at the Emirates, but Podolski nevertheless holds plenty of qualities worth hanging on to. And had the club opted to move ahead with Remy’s signing, with the Frenchman heavily linked with a move to north London, it would surely have spelt the end of Podolski’s time with the club. Wenger is known for his preference of a streamlined squad, and both forwards would, more than likely, fill the same role in the squad. WANT MORE? >> Arsenal transfer news | Latest transfer news Arsenal’s halted interest in Remy also leaves an opening for Costa Rican forward Joel Campbell to stick around for the upcoming season. Podolski and Remy could have been switched, but the depth issue would have remained the same. Instead, Campbell is available to add further quality to a side in need of strengthening, not just in bodies but in quick, capable and versatile forwards. Campbell’s exploits with his national side at the World Cup may have played an important part in Wenger’s rethinking and ultimate reluctance to move on Remy’s reported wage demands. Campbell is evidently good enough to stand up to high quality opposition and can be of great use over the next 12 months. But snubbing a move for Remy also makes financial sense, regardless of the club’s healthy financial state at this time. He wouldn’t have offered anything greater than what Arsenal currently have on the books. His pace and finishing ability is on hand in either Campbell or Podolski, while funds can be focused on rebuilding in other areas of the team, namely the centre of midfield and defence. It would be ambitious to say Arsenal don’t need another striker. The addition of Alexis and the returning Theo Walcott will do much for what was an uninspiring and oft-misfiring forward line last season, but another major star wouldn’t go amiss, something Remy evidently isn’t. With Wenger being far from the type to spend heavily on two players who can occupy the same position, his faith looks to be placed in players who could have found themselves elsewhere this season. For Podolski at the very least, Remy’s move to Liverpool will be a welcome sign for those who still wish to see the German international play his football in north London.", "score"=>162.5772, "summaryTitle"=>"A positive sign for Arsenal’s World Cup star?", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Liverpool are yet to confirm their capture of Loic Remy this summer from QPR, but Arsenal’s discontinued interest in the striker spells positive signs for L", "cities"=>"gb", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.footballfancast.com/premiership/arsenal/a-positive-sign-for-arsenals-world-cup-star", "referrer"=>["telkomsel.com", "writelonger.com", "direct", "twitter.com", "t.co", "bit.ly"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1rEmaWH", "lastseen"=>"20140725234520", "page"=>"http://www.footballfancast.com/premiership/arsenal/a-positive-sign-for-arsenals-world-cup-star", "ogtitle"=>"A positive sign for Arsenal&#8217;s World Cup star?"}, {"domain"=>"okcfox.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406334044000", "h3"=>["Firefighters: man trying to start classic corvette sparks SE OKC fire", "Firefighters: man trying to start classic corvette sparks SE OKC fire", "OKCPD: bumbling crook steals cash register from smoke shop", "OKCPD: bumbling crook steals cash register from smoke shop", "Cigarette sparks house fire in NW Oklahoma City", "Cigarette sparks house fire in NW Oklahoma City", "President Obama to meet with Central American leaders over immigration crisis", "President Obama to meet with Central American leaders over immigration crisis", "Clinic veterans call a \"life-saver\" in danger of closing by end of the week", "Clinic veterans call a \"life-saver\" in danger of closing by end of the week", "80-year-old man says he shot burglar who said she was pregnant", "80-year-old man says he shot burglar who said she was pregnant", "116 passengers and crew perish in Air Algerie flight", "116 passengers and crew perish in Air Algerie flight", "NFL player suspended two games for knocking out fiancee", "NFL player suspended two games for knocking out fiancee", "Gallup survey: majority of Americans opposed to lowering drinking age", "Gallup survey: majority of Americans opposed to lowering drinking age", "Maine prepares for new work requirement people who receive food stamps", "Maine prepares for new work requirement people who receive food stamps", "Headline", "Tell Me Something Good", "Tell Me Something Good", "Waste Watch", "Waste Watch", "Washington Times", "Washington Times"], "site"=>"www.okcfox.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004603", "keywords"=>"fox 25 oklahoma city, kokh fox 25, kokh, fox 25 okc, fox news oklahoma city, headlines, sports, weather, closings, stations, morning, oklahoma news", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335563404", "title"=>"Florida man points gun at cat's head, posts to Facebook", "initial"=>"20140726002044", "summaryText"=>"Tired of all the bad news?

Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Darrell Issa plans to vote shortly in committee to reject the White House’s claim that Simas has absolute immunity from a subpoena from Congress. The White House informed Issa that Simas would not appear at 7:30 a.m. Friday, Issa said. The absence was “not excused,” he said. White House Counsel W. Neil Eggleston asked Issa to withdraw the subpoena to discuss his offer late Thursday for Simas to give a deposition instead of subpoenaed testimony . Issa refused to do so. “We have an absolute right and obligation” to investigate the new White House Office of Political Strategy and Outreach, he said. “This was intended to be a short, and I hope it will be, oversight of a relatively small but in the past controversial office, consistent with our requirement to do oversight even without a predicate of wrongdoing,” he said. Issa says oversight of the previously troubled political office will help American people be more comfortable and ensure taxpayer dollars are being used properly. “This is not alleging a scandal at any level,” Issa of the subpoena. But oversight is still legitimate, he said. ”We are accusing neither the president nor anyone in this four-person office of any wrongdoing.” Issa pointed to Hatch Act violations by two Obama cabinet officials as well as previous incarnations of the White House political office as further justification for oversight. He said he wanted to ask Simas who coordinated the political activities of hundreds of other officials in the government beyond just the president and the first lady. Issa said that there is a legitimate role for taxpayer dollars to be spent on coordinating the president’s political schedule, pointing to the security and other concerns that would come from having the president or the first lady having to go to and from the Democratic National Committee’s offices for briefings and the like. He said he expected he would be satisfied with answers he would get from Simas regarding the activities the office engages in on behalf of the president if Simas would testify.

Two years ago, modern infrastructure came very close to a serious disruption. The culprit? One of the largest solar storms in recorded history. Plasma exploding from the surface of the sun in a coronal mass ejection barreled through space and crossed through Earth's orbital path on July 23, 2012. If the flare had erupted about one week earlier, Earth would have been squarely in the line of fire, Daniel N. Baker wrote in a study published in the journal Space Weather. (Baker is with the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado). This is not the first time solar activity has threatened Earth. A massive solar storm in 1859, dubbed the Carrington Event after the English astronomer who witnessed it, caused the northern lights to appear as far south as Cuba; and it caused telegraph lines to spark, setting fire to a number of buildings, according to Science@NASA editor Dr. Tony Phillips. \"According to data from the STEREO-A spacecraft (a solar observatory), the solar storm of July 23, 2012, was every bit as potent as the Carrington storms,\" he said. Baker said that had our planet been in the path of the storm, it would not be inconceivable that we would still be \"picking up the pieces.\" Phillips agrees. \"As society relies more and more on high technology such as GPS, the Internet, satellite communications and smart power grids, we also expose ourselves more and more to the dangers of stormy space weather.\" He added that power outages after the storm could have persisted for many months. If the solar storm had hit, much of Earth's technology would be rendered inoperable: from radios and GPS systems to toilets. Though human beings would not be physically harmed directly, a study by the National Academy of Sciences estimates that damage from a coronal mass ejection of similar magnitude could exceed $2 trillion in the United States and pose risks to national security. While Earth did get lucky in 2012, humans should not get too comfortable. Despite the relatively mild conditions on the sun, solar storms are unpredictable. According to Baker, \"incredibly powerful\" space weather is possible at any time.", "score"=>162.53146, "summaryTitle"=>"Solar storm barely missed earth in 2012", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Two years ago, modern infrastructure came very close to a serious disruption.

Greg McNeil - Cape Breton Post Former employees remember time spent in Cape Breton's first \"retail giant\" HOWIE CENTRE — Memories of fantastic managers, friendly customers and nationally famous sales at a former retail giant were shared at a recent gathering on a farm in Howie Centre.

The memories were shared by many of the former employees who spent 10, 20 and even 30 years inside Woolco's location at the Cape Breton Plaza in Sydney River. At that time, the big department store concept was relatively new to the area. Stores like Zellers and K-Mart would also open in the same era. \"It was something when Woolco opened,\" said Josephine MacLeod, who helps organize the current reunions. \"It was unbelievable with wall-to-wall people. We had a very busy day. They filled their carts up.\" She said they came from all over Cape Breton that first day and returned often, especially for big sales like $1.44 days which many still remember to this day. \"It was on the first Monday of every month and that was a big do,\" she said. \"We'd go to work in the morning and there would be a lineup outside the store. They'd be standing out there for about an hour before they could get in.\" Items available ranged from three bottles of dish detergent to two gallons of bleach for $1.44. China cups and other items were also snapped up quickly. \"As soon as they got in, there wasn't a cart available. Managers would take cardboard boxes and tie ropes on them and give them to customers to shop.\" Old-fashioned days were another great memory of note and saw Woolco employees go about their business in clothes from days gone by. \"That went on for three days. That wasn't very comfortable let me tell you. The managers and everybody dressed up.\" Marilyn Morris was just 21 when she started work at Woolco in the furniture department before moving to housewares in her 30-year career. \"Customers were fantastic and we got to know a lot of them and they knew us because they were in every second or third day,\" Morris said. \"There's people you meet now who you come across and you'd say I remember you coming into the store.\" Three months prior to the store's opening in 1964, Morris was among the employees who helped set it up in advance of the full opening. She also did the same when Woolco expanded to other parts of Atlantic Canada. An added bonus of the Woolco experience was meeting her future husband. \"I lived in the Pier. He used to drive the transit buses and I bused to work,\" she recalled. \"When I first started at Woolco, I worked 1-10 p.m. and had to take two buses to go to work.\" Elsie Furlong mostly worked in the lamp department and also has great memories of customers, even the ones that gave her a hard time. \"One time we had a lady who always wanted a refund for everything (she bought),\" she recalled with a laugh. \"She'd always bring things back.\" One time the woman in question showed up with a broken lamp that had been glued back together. Furlong, who knew her inventory inside and out and immediately knew the lamp was not from Woolco, didn't want to give her a refund. When the assistant manager Jack Saunders was called to intervene he immediately offered a refund. Before they left for the day, Furlong asked him why? \"I said, 'you gave that lady a refund for those lamps. I said they belong to Zellers or K-Mart of something.' He said 'it's all right, we don't want to lose a customer.' That was the story of that day.\" She said all the managers she worked with were as friendly and accommodating as Saunders. It made for a nice working environment at the store. \"When I went to work I enjoyed getting up in the morning and going. I loved my job and the girls were the same way.\" Woolco was simply a great store to work in, added MacLeod. \"Everybody was so good to each other. That's why we try to get together as much as we can.\" Usually reunions take place in November to celebrate Christmas, but the former employees often get together at other times during the year. \"We had one on our 40th and that was a big reunion at the Westmount Fire Hall with 200 people,\" said MacLeod. \"Then 12 years ago we started having suppers every Christmas, in November. \"This year we decided to have the party up at Alice Tobin's.

Three weeks ago, Nicole and Malcolm Graham found a one-year-old dog on their lawn. They kept it overnight, and say it behaved like any other pup. “He went through the gamut, he played with our dogs in the backyard,” Malcolm Graham says. “We didn’t see anything that made us nervous.” The next day they contacted Animal Services in hopes of returning ‘Kingston’ to his family, but his owners couldn’t be tracked down. The city then took it in for behavioural assessments which are standard procedure for adoptions—but Kingston failed the tests. Graham says the city refused their numerous offers to try and help the dog themselves. “They wouldn’t even entertain the idea of exploring options and bringing experts who are suited to this exact issue to the dog. We suggested to the city that we put the dog in a familiar environment and in training for specifically high-anxiety dogs. We committed to pay for that ourselves.” The city says that the dog displayed fear, which usually leads to aggression, and they couldn’t take the risk of adopting Kingston out. “In my opinion, if we adopt a dog out knowing that there’s a problem, we would still hold some liability,” explains Doug Anderson from Animal and Bylaw Services. “Because we were aware of it and still proceeded.” Kingston was put down on Friday afternoon.

We buy insurance to protect us from misfortune and the times when lady luck lets us down.  But there is one type of insurance that people buy to protect them from the consequences of unusually good luck: In Japan, the U.K., and, to a lesser extent, around the world, golfers buy insurance to protect themselves from the potentially bankrupting consequences of sinking a hole in one. The concept of hole in one insurance may baffle the uninitiated, but to many it is a wise precaution as golf tradition holds that anyone who scores a hole in one should buy drinks back at the clubhouse for his playing group -- if not everyone present. In Japan, many give extravagant gifts to friends and family after scoring a lucky ace.  In our research, we failed to dig up a definitive account of how the tradition became so entrenched. It likely came out of exuberant golfers buying rounds of drinks for friends and even strangers. Perhaps it was influenced by the idea behind many traditions of someone who experiences a great success humbling him or herself. (In judo, for example, anyone promoted to a higher belt is celebrated by being thrown onto his or her back by everyone else in the room). Clubhouses also likely promoted the tradition as a way to drive up bar tabs, while some speculate that golf courses, which often put up a plaque for holes in one, may have formalized the tradition to discourage golfers from making false claims.  However it happened, the tradition has turned a hole in one into something that is equally celebrated and insured against like a calamity -- or at least a micro-calamity. After spending $650 buying the entire clubhouse champagne at England’s South Winchester Golf Club following a hole in one, Paul Neilson told Bloomberg , “I couldn't afford to go through all that again. I used to have a policy but never got around to renewing it.” Among the stories from Japan, the same article quotes Eiji Yoneda, who was one of 200 people invited on a dinner cruise by someone celebrating a hole in one. A number of firms offer hole in one insurance, frequently bundled with other services that golfers commonly buy like insurance for golfing equipment or personal liability. (Apparently yelling “Fore!” can’t ward off lawsuits if you hit a ball right at someone.) Golfplan, a U.K. insurer, covers $340 to $510 worth of drinks for hole in one celebrations. (Clubs’ set of rules for validating a hole in one makes it easier to process claims.) When it is sold unbundled, hole in one insurance can be cheap; Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co. Ltd offers Japanese golfers hole in one insurance for as little as a $3 premium . Outside of individual policies, golf tournaments also get hole in one insurance so that they can offer huge cash prizes for a hole in one as a marketing promotion -- it's the same type of \"prize indemnity\" insurance that covers teams when a fan sinks a half court shot or makes a field goal. In the United States, where the custom is less firmly established, golf forums are filled with debate about what tradition demands. Some clubs have written the tradition into their rules. The New York Times  notes that the membership dues at one San Francisco club include covering $250 worth of drinks to celebrate any hole in one, while a similar system at a club in Bremerton, Washington, gives pro shop and food and beverage credit to the lucky golfer -- it’s up to him or her to share. Where clubs don’t have set rules, many people suggest only buying drinks for friends and playing partners rather than the entire clubhouse.  Other golfers admit to fearing the wrath of a spouse if they treat the clubhouse, and therefore having agreed with golfing buddies to slip away quietly without telling the clubhouse if anyone scores a hole in one. It’s a rather sad result of the tradition -- instead of celebrating a hole in one like the once in a lifetime accomplishment that it is (the odds of getting a hole in one , very roughly, are 12,500 to 1 for an amateur and 7,500 to 1 for a professional), it pushes golfers to slink away like they crashed a golf cart in a sand trap. In the great American tradition of ignoring tradition, a number of other golfers have decided to ignore the debate entirely (several golfers say they'll ignore this tradition as it originated when only “the upper classes” played golf) or to put the focus back on the lucky golfer. “ If I ever hit an ace I'm going to flip the script on everyone else,” says one golfer. “They should all be buying ME drinks… not the other way around!” This post was written by Alex Mayyasi.

(AP) — Police planned Friday to give prosecutors the results of their investigation into an 80-year-old man's fatal shooting of one of two burglars who attacked him when he found them ransacking his home. Tom Greer, whose collarbone was broken in the assault, told a television station he fired even though the female burglar told him not to shoot because she was pregnant. The woman's alleged accomplice was being held for investigation of murder and police said Thursday they had yet to decide whether to recommend any charges be brought against the octogenarian homeowner. \"She says, 'Don't shoot me, I'm pregnant — I'm going to have a baby,' and I shot her anyway,\" Greer told KNBC-TV outside his house. Long Beach police Chief Jim McDonnell said at a news conference Thursday that the woman, 28-year-old Andrea Miller, did not appear to be pregnant, but an autopsy would determine whether she was. The surviving suspect, Gus Adams, 26, has been arrested on suspicion of residential burglary and murder, McDonnell said. The murder charge is possible because he is accused of being involved in a felony that led to a death, the chief said. He was being held on bail just over $1 million, and police did not know if he had hired an attorney. Both Miller and Adams, who had histories of similar crimes, were unarmed, McDonnell said. Greer had been burglarized three times before and believed the same suspects were responsible. He returned home shortly after 9 p.m. Tuesday to find the pair in his home. Both suspects attacked him, hitting him with their fists and ultimately \"body slamming\" him to the floor, breaking his collar bone, McDonnell said. Miller continued to hit him, McDonnell said, while Adams moved to a safe and began trying to pry it open. The homeowner was able to get to another room where he grabbed a gun and returned to open fire on the suspects. They fled through the garage and into an alley, and Greer gave chase, firing at them again outside, McDonnell said. Miller was hit, collapsed in the alley and died at the scene, McDonnell said. \"The lady didn't run as fast as the man, so I shot her in the back twice,\" Greer told the TV station. \"She's dead ... but he got away.\" McDonnell would not say whether Miller was shot in the back as Greer said. He also declined to say how many shots were fired and whether either of the suspects was hit inside the house before fleeing. No phone listing was available for Greer and he could not be reached for comment by The Associated Press. It will be up to the district attorney to decide whether to charge Greer with a crime, the chief said. Under California law, homeowners can defend themselves if they are in \"imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death,\" he said. Prosecutors will have to determine whether chasing after the suspects and firing on them outside the home goes beyond self-defense, McDonnell said. AP: Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.

Since its official", "content"=>"‘H e who controls the past controls the future,” observed George Orwell. “He who controls the present controls the past.” This, in one pithy, symmetrical little maxim, has been the story of Obamacare from its conception to the present day. Since its official launch, in October of 2013, the architects and salesmen of our ill-conceived phalanx of reforms have been engaged in some of the most pronounced historical revisionism of the modern era — truth being subjugated to expedience; idealism being repackaged in the pathetic language of good intentions; and the past being tweaked at every tricky stage. Thus has the ironclad promise that insurance premiums would decrease for all people given way to scoffing admissions that “of course” some people’s premiums would increase. Thus has the quixotic assurance that there would be no winners and losers been transmuted into the defensive insistence that there are no perfect plans but that this one was “worth it overall.” Thus has a favored vow that anybody who “liked” their existing plan would be able to “keep it” replaced with the patronizing mantra that people just don’t know what’s good for them — and need in consequence to be told what they may buy. Thus has the claim of “universal health insurance” been quickly forgotten, a series of unseemly statistical victory dances being offered in lieu. And thus — now that it looks as if the executive’s attempt to circumvent the rules will meet meaningful resistance in the courts — has the scheme’s legally established architecture been reimagined as a “typo” or a “mistake” or a “drafting error,” and the damning confirmations of the law’s mastermind rewritten as the feverish claims of a churlish right-wing coup.  Today, we are witnessing the fall from grace of the progressive health-care wonk, Jonathan Gruber, a primary architect of Obamacare who is renouncing his previous testimony with all the giddy enthusiasm of a veteran clerk in the Kruschev administration. Once upon a time, Gruber was admirably honest on the subject of how his creation worked, and what it did and did not permit the federal government to achieve. On a tour of the country in 2012, Gruber urged recalcitrant states to set up their own health insurance exchanges, explaining in no uncertain terms the consequences of their declining to do so. A video unearthed by the Competitive Enterprise Institute shows Gruber not merely laying out how the law works, but why it works as it does. “What’s important to remember politically about” Obamacare, Gruber explains, in what he happily refers to as a “verifiable, objective” presentation, “is if you’re a state and you don’t set up an exchange, that means your citizens don’t get their tax credits.” Why not? Because, while the federal government is permitted to establish an exchange per se, it is not permitted to offer any tax subsidies through it. “The law,” Gruber records flatly, “says if the states don’t provide [the exchanges], the federal backstop will. The federal government has been sort of slow in putting out its backstop, I think partly because they want to sort of squeeze the states to do it.” This, Gruber contended, was a “blatant enough political reality,” and one that he hoped would be enough for states to “get their act together and recognize there are billions of dollars at stake here in setting up these exchanges” — billions of dollars, he went to great lengths to clarify, that would not be available through a federal exchange. No state exchange, he explained, no money. Refuse to establish one, and “your citizens still pay the taxes that support this bill.” “So, he concluded, “you’re essentially saying to your citizens, you’re going to pay all the taxes to help all the other states in the country.” One month earlier, Gruber had made precisely the same point in  prepared remarks , describing states not setting up changes as the “ultimate threat,” and hoping aloud that “people understand that, gee, if your governor doesn’t set up an exchange, you’re losing hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits to be delivered to your citizens.” These clear, unequivocal, straightforward, uncomplex, honest adumbrations of the matter could have come straight out of the plantiff’s case in Halbig v. Burwell , the court case that raised the issue this week. Indeed, as Cato’s Michael Cannon says today, he couldn’t have put them better himself. Fast forward a year or so, though, and you will see Gruber radically change his tune. In an interview with Mother Jones , conducted in early 2013, Gruber claimed that the very same “interpretation” (read: plain meaning) that he had offered in January of 2012 was — now that it was being offered by opponents of the law — “screwy,” “nutty,” “stupid,” and “desperate,” representing an approach that only fierce partisans could consider to be intellectually serious. What could possibly have happened in the interim to have changed his mind? A review of the relevant history reveals a number of things: 1) The majority of states had refused to play ball and set up exchanges, rejecting Gruber’s advice and confounding an administration in Washington that had expected them to bluster and gripe a little and then to acquiesce in full; 2) the IRS had responded to that lack of interest by issuing an illegal, ultra vires rule that promised subsidies for the federal exchanges, despite their being no grounds for this in the statute; and 3) most worrying of all, the law’s opponents had noticed, Jonathan Adler and Michael Cannon having published a paper that first highlighted the problem, and then informed a challenge in court. Reeling, politics took over and Gruber elected to rewrite history. Today, he went for the full reversal. “I honestly don’t remember why I said that,” he told The New Republic . “I was speaking off-the-cuff.” From “verifiable” and “objective” prepared remarks to “off the cuff,” “screwy,” and “desperate” in just two-and-a-half years? We have always been at war with Eastasia. Those of us who have been critical of Obamacare’s endless textual invitations to leave the details of national policy up “the secretary” have often referred to the law as an “enabling act” — as a perilous general warrant that transfers the prerogatives of Congress to the executive branch and substitutes the codified work of citizen-approved legislators for the transient whims of a haughty mandarin class. Little did we know just how appropriate our critique would become. There being nothing in America’s constitutional settlement that permits a president to recast the rules if they prove electorally inconvenient for him, the Obama administration’s repeated rewriting of the law has been vexing enough in isolation. Far worse, however, is that in the eyes of the expansionist Left, Obamacare seems not to represent a limited series of binding and meaningful words on a page — there to be implemented within the usual bounds of discretion — but a holistic permission slip for its aims. Increasingly, its defenders’ arguments are boiling down to “but this is a good idea,” an approach that renders Obamacare as little more than a shell into which good intentions can be poured without limit and that cannot legitimately be resisted — not by Congress, not by the states, and not even by the courts. “Sure,” the attitude dictates, “it doesn’t say we can do that explicitly. But all right-thinking people believe we should.” “Yes,” say the footsoldiers, “this was fought over tooth and nail and passed in extreme circumstances. But the intent of the good guys should prevail nonetheless.” Meanwhile, anyone who pushes back is met with the same mawkish, manipulative cry: “Are you really going to take away from people what we have now given them?” The answer to this question should be a resounding “yes.” Yes, if you had no authority to give out favors in the first instance. Yes, if you insist upon behaving with no regard for memory or for history. Yes, if you are determined to hijack the system and ride roughshod over the consent of the governed. “Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored,” Aldous Huxley once wrote. The rule of law, neither. Reality is not optional, and power is not its arbiter — whatever our celebrated experts might find it convenient to forget. — Charles C. W.

We need a down payment on an apartment. We think putting our money toward that is more prudent than buying a fancy wedding dress or floral arrangements. Is there a nice way to tell our families this and still reap the rewards of a wedding (in cash)? This lady sounds tired and exasperated, and who wouldn't be? She's powered through a dozen family weddings and now she feels pressured to empty her bank account for something she just flat doesn't want. If her family is breathing down her neck to throw some big shindig, they're jerks. Your money is yours to do with as you please. Throw a big wedding, don't throw a big wedding. In the words of T.I., you can have whatever you like. But as for whether she and her fiance can \"reap the rewards of a wedding (in cash)\" without actually having SOME sort of wedding—sorry, it doesn't work that way. And the question is a pretty good illustration of how screwy our ideas about these gifts have gotten. The letter writer has fallen into a pretty common trap. Many people seem to feel weddings are exchanges: I provide you with a meal and a good time, and you provide me with $100 worth of flatware. Registries have exacerbated this. They exist because your great aunt definitely wants to buy you SOMETHING, but has no idea what kind of dishes you like. Yet many couples act like they're five years old and creating a Christmas list for Santa. It's very easy to slip into this mentality when you're standing in the middle of Pottery Barn with a registry gun! But wedding presents aren't supposed to be a \"reward\" for an event well-staged. Nor are they something to which you are entitled, simply for tying the knot. They're supposed to be an assist in getting your home established, a gesture of goodwill from members of your family and community. Like a barn-raising. Problem is, the whole model is a hold-over from the days when couples didn't cohabitate before marriage. We do need to reevaluate what counts as an acceptable wedding gift. Cash feels impersonal to many, but for some couples, it's plain and simply the best way to help them get their lives off the ground. But that conversation needs to happen on a broader level. On an individual level, you can't simply announce that all these weddings have been a stupid waste of money and you don't need any dumb crystal and by GOD we're going to be responsible and focus on assembling our down payment, won't you please contribute? Know that requesting cash is a bold move that might go over badly, and you must proceed with the utmost tact. The Times' advice is pretty spot-on : There is no logical difference between a registry of gifts and a request for cash. (Happy now?) What's more, the fiction that relatives or close friends must break the (shocking) news that there exists a registry, and never a member of the bridal couple, is also foolish and may be dispensed with. But, like items on a registry, contributions to your down-payment fund should be softly suggested, not foot-stomping demands. They also suggest that without inviting people to some sort of public ceremony (even a dirt-cheap one!), you're probably not going to receive many gifts. You've got to involve them. Who wants to send a present when you've been excluded from something? So, sure, feel free to set up some sort of honeyfund. You can gently, gently hint that you don't need many pots and pans, and your down payment is your current priority. But know that guests are going to give you whatever they're going to give you. Some people give the same Waterford vase to every couple they know. You might think it's silly, but you've still got to write the thank-you note.

Rabbit season. Content marketing conference season. There are tons of fantastic learning opportunities out there for pro and novice digital marketers alike, and it so happens that September (it’ll be here before you know it!) has an incredible lineup to check out. So, without further ado get out your calendars and—in the order in which they occur—let’s take a look at eight different digital marketing-related conferences happening that month and see if we can figure out which one(s) are going to be the programs you’ll tell your grandkids about 30 years from now. 1. Content Marketing World Undoubtedly the biggest and one of the most popular content marketing conferences of the year, Content Marketing World, organized by The Content Marketing Institute, is being held September 8-11, 2014 at the Cleveland Convention Center in Cleveland, Ohio. Prices range from $495 to $2,135, with various levels of activity and engagement included. Check out the details here : “Content Marketing World is the one event where you can learn and network with the best and the brightest in the content marketing industry. You will leave with all the materials you need to take a content marketing strategy back to your team and to implement a content marketing plan that will grow your business and inspire your audience.” Now in its fourth year, Content Marketing World has carved out an impressive place in the digital marketing space and continues to improve on previous years’ efforts. Take some time to review details of who’s speaking and about what —and don’t miss Kevin Spacey giving the closing keynote speech! (Editor’s Note: Shameless plug, but Contently CCO Shane Snow will be giving a talk at Content Marketing World on “Storytelling & The Next Level of Content Marketing.”) 2) Call to Action Conference This one-day conference, organized by the landing page conversion experts at Unbounce, is predictably focused solely on improving conversion rates. The main event is being held September 12 at the SFU Goldcorp Center in Vancouver, British Columbia,and Unbounce is also hosting a Welcome Reception the night before the conference and a day of casual recreation for attendees the day after. Ticket prices are just $499, which feels like a steal when you review the action-packed agenda . “Jam-packed with actionable & exciting content by expert speakers, CTA Conf will make you jump out of your seat and implement what you’ve learned. You can expect keynotes, panels and discussions focused around landing page campaigns, conversion optimization, design and a/b testing.” If your digital marketing efforts rely on conversion (whose doesn’t?), there’s a lot to love about this single-track series of talks and workshops. 3) INBOUND Organized annually by Boston-based HubSpot, INBOUND may just be the most fun digital marketing conference of the month. There are loads of entertainment scheduled before and after the concert, including a concert, daily happy hours, and a casual tour of HubSpot HQ. It’s scheduled for September 15-18, 2014 at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. An all-access pass will cost you $1,199 (this is the current discount through August 15 when it goes up to $1,499), but you also have the option to attend only the four keynote addresses and the entertainment for just $149. If you’re a student with a valid student ID, you can get all the value of the all-access pass for just $199! Here’s their pitch: “INBOUND’s purpose is to provide the inspiration, education, and connections you need to transform your business. This September, we will host thousands of marketing and sales professionals from almost every industry imaginable and from all corners of the globe at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center.” With keynote speakers like Martha Stewart, Simon Sinek, and David Meerman-Scott lined up, along with inbound experts like Chris Brogan, Guy Kawasaki, and John Janstch, you can expect some great learning. Get the full agenda here . 4) The FT Future of Marketing Summit A one day event, the Future of Marketing Summit organized by Financial Times promises to be fast-paced and action-packed. It’s scheduled for September 17, 2014 and is being held at The Time Warner Center, 10 at the Park, in New York City. Early bird pricing (before August 15) is $1,195, and after that you’ll pay $1,495 for a ticket. For that price, you get a full day of insightful marketing information, networking opportunities, and two meals provided: “The 2nd annual Future of Marketing Summit, hosted by the Financial Times, brings together the most forward-thinking marketers, innovators and entrepreneurs to discuss the leading edge of the evolving marketing landscape. Through a series of thought-provoking interviews, discussion, debate and case studies, this program will tackle the fundamental areas of communities, culture and creativity.” Although it could just be selective attendee announcements causing this slant, it appears that the FT conference attracts more C-suite and Director-level attendees than other major conferences; it’s also more heavily geared toward Fortune 500 businesses and above. 5) The Content Marketing Summit The Content Marketing Summit, hosted by NewsCred, is scheduled for September 18, 2014, and you can show up a day early for an afternoon of pre-conference workshops on September 17. It’s being held at the Metropolitan Pavilion in New York City. Unfortunately, no information is available regarding price—maybe it’s free?? “Bringing together 300+ leaders in marketing, media and technology, the second annual Content Marketing Summit will explore how content is redefining the future of marketing.” Based on the feedback from last year , The Content Marketing Summit was a huge success, and this year’s list of speakers and agenda topics promises more of the same. 6) BrandManage Camp BrandManage Camp has a dedicated, consistent following with many professionals returning year after year—after all, they’ve been going strong for 12 years. Their recap video from 2013 contains some really strong testimonials . This year’s conference is happening September 18-19, 2014 at the MGM Grand Conference Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Their focus is broad: branding in all its flavors. Until the end of July, your ticket price will be $2,299. After that it goes up $100 until the end of August, then another $100 for the month of September. Discounts apply for groups as well as qualified government, non-profit, and academic attendees. “Now in its 12th year, the Brand ManageCamp marketing conference has become THE place to be to generate the FRESHideas brands need to survive – especially in these turbulent times. Join hundreds of other senior-level brand marketers for an oasis of fresh thinking and inspiration across a wide range of exciting, timely, and relevant subjects—including Brand Strategy, Innovation, Advertising, Brand Messaging, Content Marketing, Brand Experience, New Media, Insights, Creativity, Consumer/Customer Behavior, Leadership, Digital Marketing, Metrics, and more.” The agenda shows a strong leaning toward digital marketing education, although classic branding disciplines make a fair showing as well. All the speakers are executives or expert authors in their fields, and you can see preview videos of many of them on the Agenda page . 7) The Sales 2.0 Conference While the Sales 2.0 Conference is focused primarily on sales, the agenda shows they do a good job of marrying sales and marketing, especially in the digital realm. The conference will occur on September 18, 2014 at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. (If you wanted to split up travel costs with a buddy, one of you could attend Sales 2.0 while the other attends BrandManage Camp! Of course, the one going to Sales 2.0 would probably lose his shirt at the craps table on September 19—but I digress.) Less expensive than many conferences, if you buy your ticket before August 14, you only pay $495 to attend Sales 2.0. The price goes up as high as $625 for latecomers, though. “The Sales 2.0 Conference, Las Vegas will provide leaders in B2B sales, marketing and sales operation tactics that are proven to accelerate sales growth, enable strategic change, and transform your sales organization for success in 2014. You will learn insights from an expert community comprised of top sales executives, consultants, industry leaders, and analysts. Join us on September 18th; learn how to optimize sales process and strategy for improved results.” If your job requirements involve direct selling, oversight of sales, or any communication between marketing and sales, you’re likely to find this conference valuable. 8) The AMA’s Annual Marketing Conference While not limited strictly to digital marketing, the venerable AMA Conference is guaranteed to include plenty of actionable learning for digital marketing pros, along with exposure to other aspects of marketing that can help round out what you already know. It is scheduled for September 30—October 2, 2014, and is being held at the Sheraton New Orleans in New Orleans, Louisiana. If you’re a member of the American Marketing Association, your ticket price is $1,200 for the main event. Non-members pay an additional $200. There are also a number of optional tutorials available for an extra $275 each. “Join the AMA and over 400 marketing peers & thought leaders this fall as the AMA again provides inspiration, focus and motivation to help marketers deliver top results! The American Marketing Association’s Annual Conference will inspire you with rich content and expert insights from some of the nation’s best marketing minds. Attendees will leave up-to-date on the latest evolution of strategies and innovations.” Again, the conference is not focused just on digital marketing, so their list of speakers and agenda items run the gamut of industries and marketing disciplines. But there’s sure to be fantastic information available, and you can access “sneak peeks” at many of the upcoming presentations at the AMA’s website. So, there are eight different options for sharpening your digital marketing tools with fresh ideas and insights in September. Of course, if you had roughly $10,000 (+ travel expenses) and a half-dozen clones of yourself to send to various points across North America, you could benefit from them all. But since that’s out of reach for most of us, take some time to review the list above more closely and check out every linked site, and pick at least one that’s going to be your investment in yourself this fall.

The girls, identified as Jennifer Emoke Greene, 18; and a 15-year-old juvenile, were both charged with felony cruelty to animals and a misdemeanor charge of taking, harassing, harming or killing a gopher tortoise, according to commission spokeswoman Karen Parker. The two were arrested at about 11 a.m. at the younger girl’s home on Parkridge Avenue, according to Parker. The arrest comes a little more than a week after animal rights officials in Nevada saw graphic Facebook video of a young gopher tortoise being burned, tortured and ultimately crushed to death and alerted Florida wildlife officials, who launched an investigation with the State Attorneys Office. “We received a tip about the torture and death of the tortoise and immediately followed up,” Parker said. “We take these issues extremely seriously and appreciate the public’s help. We received many complaints about the video and many calls to our wildlife alert number. The gopher tortoise has been listed as a threatened species in Florida since 2007, that listing an upgrade from its previous “species of special concern” designation. The two videos re-posted by Nevada Voters for Animals after the girls removed them are very graphic. The first one shows the girls dousing the tortoise with alcohol and lighting it ablaze as the creature runs in circles through the flames. The tortoise tries to run after one of the girls douses it with fluid again. “Burn baby, burn baby,” one girl says as they light the tortoise on fire. “Now you are scared of us, huh?” They agree to throw the tortoise, one girl picking it up and throwing it as the other girl laughs. “Do it again. Let’s do it again,” the videographer said. “Let me do it. He’s not dead. He just went in his shell.” The second video is more graphic as one girl stomps on the tortoise until it is dead, its organs forced through a cracked carapace. “His heart came out with a bunch of grass,” the girl with the camera says as she laughs, then kicks the corpse. “He’s dead. That’s funny. ... He’s still alive though. No he’s not.” “He’s dead,” the girl with the pink top says. “His eyes are closed.” Neither girl would comment when a Times-Union reporter went to the home last week.

Residents are allowed back home now, but they tell CBS13 News that the fire was an unwelcome reminder of what happened just 15 months ago in the same neighborhood. They say the sound of sirens is all too familiar and when they heard the fire trucks at about 6:30 p.m. Thursday, they feared the worst. Twins Gabby and Jade Foss were sleeping when flames broke out in the attic of their apartment building. “I was scared,” Jade said. “I smelled something out of my window and I woke up quick to get out of the house.” Their mom Jessica Doyle was the first person to see the flames. “My heart went down in my throat and I just was worried about getting everyone out of the building,” Doyle said. So she, her fiancé, and her two young girls started pounding frantically on their neighbors' doors. They helped forty people escape, nearly half of them children. The kids say they were afraid of the flames. Their parents, though, scared of the consequences. “I thought we would be homeless like everyone else that's had a fire here in Lewiston,” Doyle said. She was referring to the hundreds of people who fell victim to arson last year. One of them is Doyle’s best friend, Brittany Dunn. “It's hard,” Dunn said at the fire scene. “It brings back a lot of memories.” She lost everything when an arsonist set fire to her Blake Street apartment building in 2013. Friday, she was a source of comfort for the most recent victims. “I am just trying to help out in any kind of way because I know what it’s like,” Dunn said. For the adults, it’s a sense of relief that this fire was just an accident. But for all the kids, the scare is just the same. “I don’t know how this happened,” said Samantha Kennedy, “But I know everyone is safe and sound right now.” Fire officials say the cause of the fire was an electrical short in the attic.

Yesterday, coach Dennis Allen said there’s a chance Hayden could miss all of training camp. Obviously, given Hayden’s injury history, it’s always better to guess on the side of Hayden missing more time than him coming back ahead of schedule. In fact, this is probably well past time that even Raiders GM Reggie McKenzie, who selected Hayden with the 12th overall pick in 2013 (after trading down from No. 3), should shift into a pure realistic assessment of Hayden: Hayden is a Raiders’ non-factor, not part of its present or possibly it’s future, until he can prove he should be something else, and he hasn’t come close to doing that in a year plus as an NFL player. He’s a write-off for the McKenzie regime that cannot afford many of these. In any judgment of the GM’s overall reconstruction of the Raiders over two-plus seasons, the Hayden pick (UNTIL AND UNLESS HAYDEN COMES BACK AND PRODUCES) is now essentially a wash-out, a whiff, a burned pick with the slight chance of turning out OK on the back end. That’s blunt, but it has been the way this has gone almost from the moment McKenzie made the pick. I started hearing loud rumblings about Hayden   (and the Menelik Watson selection in the next round) almost immediately after the draft and into the 2013 off-season, and I wrote about what I was hearing. Which got Raiders fans really, really mad at me. But the truth is McKenzie could’ve drafted a lot of other very intriguing players at 12 (Sheldon Richardson, Star Lotulelei, Eric Reid). And instead, with the first first-round pick of his tenure, McKenzie took a guy who missed almost all of the off-season work and training camp last season, played 8 games (not well) in 2013, missed much of the off-season work this spring… And now might miss all of the 2014 camp. Of course, McKenzie has made many other decisions as GM, some of which might lead to a huge turn-around. The Khalil Mack pick this year is impossible to debate and if Mack becomes a dominant linebacker, then a lot of things can be overlooked. Matt Schaub could change the offense. Derek Carr could be a great QB down the road. Maurice Jones-Drew, Justin Tuck, Donald Penn, James Jones, LaMarr Woodley, Tarell Brown and the rest could give the Raiders a backbone they haven’t had in a while. If McKenzie hits on most or all of those things, I will give him full credit for it; slightly more importantly, if he hits on these things, the Raiders will be a far better team than they’ve been since he and Allen took over.

Neuroimaging research reveals the disturbances in the brain's learning circuits and neurotransmitters that accompany stressful learning environments. The neuroscientific research about learning has revealed the negative impact of stress and anxiety and the qualitative improvement of the brain circuitry involved in memory and executive function that accompanies positive motivation and engagement. The Proven Effects of Positive Motivation Thankfully, this information has led to the development of brain-compatible strategies to help students through the bleak terrain created by some of the current trends imposed by the Common Core State Standards and similar mandates. With brain-based teaching strategies that reduce classroom anxiety and increase student connection to their lessons, educators can help students learn more effectively. In the past two decades, neuroimaging and brain-mapping research have provided objective support to the student-centered educational model. This brain research demonstrates that superior learning takes place when classroom experiences are relevant to students' lives, interests, and experiences. Lessons can be stimulating and challenging without being intimidating, and the increasing curriculum requirements can be achieved without stress, anxiety, boredom, and alienation as the pervasive emotions of the school day. During my 15 years of practicing adult and child neurology with neuroimaging and brain mapping as part of my diagnostic tool kit, I worked with children and adults with brain function disorders, including learning differences. When I then returned to university to obtain my credential and Masters of Education degree, these familiar neuroimaging tools had become available to education researchers. Their widespread use in schools and classrooms globally has yet to occur. This brain research demonstrates that superior learning takes place when classroom experiences are motivating and engaging. Positive motivation impacts brain metabolism, conduction of nerve impulses through the memory areas, and the release of neurotransmitters that increase executive function and attention. Relevant lessons help students feel that they are partners in their education, and they are engaged and motivated. We live in a stressful world and troubled times, and that is not supposed to be the way for children to grow up. Schools can be the safe haven where academic practices and classroom strategies provide children with emotional comfort and pleasure as well as knowledge. When teachers use strategies to reduce stress and build a positive emotional environment, students gain emotional resilience and learn more efficiently and at higher levels of cognition. Neuroimaging and EEG Studies Studies of electrical activity (EEG or brain waves) and metabolic activity (from specialized brain scans measuring glucose or oxygen use and blood flow) show the synchronization of brain activity as information passes from the sensory input processing areas of the somatosensory cortex to the reticular activating and limbic systems. For example, bursts of brain activity from the somatosensory cortex are followed milliseconds later by bursts of electrical activity in the hippocampus, amygdala, and then the other parts of the limbic system. This data from one of the most exciting areas of brain-based learning research gives us a way to see which techniques and strategies stimulate or impede communication between the parts of the brain when information is processed and stored. In other words, properly applied, we can identify and remove barriers to student understanding! The amygdala is part of limbic system in the temporal lobe. It was first believed to function as a brain center for responding primarily to anxiety and fear. Indeed, when the amygdala senses threat, it becomes over-activated. In students, these neuroimaging findings in the amygdala are seen with feelings of helplessness and anxiety. When the amygdala is in this state of stress-induced over-activation, new sensory information cannot pass through it to access the memory and association circuits. This is the actual neuroimaging visualization of what has been called the affective filter by Stephen Krashen and others. This term describes an emotional state of stress in students during which they are not responsive to learning and storing new information. What is now evident on brain scans during times of stress is objective physical evidence of this affective filter. With such evidence-based research, the affective filter theories cannot be disparaged as \"feel-good education\" or an \"excuse to coddle students\" -- if students are stressed out, the information cannot get in. This is a matter of science. This affective state occurs when students feel alienated from their academic experience and anxious about their lack of understanding. Consider the example of the decodable \"books\" used in phonics-heavy reading instruction. These are not engaging and motivating. They are usually not relevant to the students' lives because their goal is to include words that can be decoded based on the lesson. Decodability is often at the expense of authentic meaning to the child. Reading becomes tedious and, for some children, confusing and anxiety-provoking. In this state, there is reduced passage of information through the neural pathways from the amygdala to higher cognitive centers of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex, where information is processed, associated, and stored for later retrieval and executive functioning. Additional neuroimaging studies of the amygdala, hippocampus, and the rest of the limbic system, along with measurement of dopamine and other brain chemical transmitters during the learning process, reveal that students' comfort level has critical impact on information transmission and storage in the brain. The factors that have been found to affect this comfort level such as self-confidence, trust and positive feelings for teachers, and supportive classroom and school communities are directly related to the state of mind compatible with the most successful learning, remembering, and higher-order thinking. The Power of Joyful Learning The highest-level executive thinking, making connections, and \"aha\" moments of insight and creative innovation are more likely to occur in an atmosphere of what Alfie Kohn calls exuberant discovery , where students of all ages retain that kindergarten enthusiasm of embracing each day with the joy of learning. With current research and data in the field of neuroscience, we see growing opportunities to coordinate the design of curriculum, instruction, and assessment in ways that will reflect these incredible discoveries. Joy and enthusiasm are absolutely essential for learning to happen -- literally, scientifically, as a matter of fact and research. Shouldn't it be our challenge and opportunity to design learning that embraces these ingredients?", "score"=>162.18521, "summaryTitle"=>"The Neuroscience Behind Stress and Learning", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Neuroimaging and EEG studies provide a scientific basis for the sometimes controversial belief that children become better learners when they actually enjoy learning.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.edutopia.org/blog/neuroscience-behind-stress-and-learning-judy-willis", "referrer"=>["radteach.com", "twitterrific.com", "direct", "twitter.com", "t.co", "lnkd.in", "tweetlist.com", "facebook.com", "linkis.com", "csne-erc.org", "linkedin.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1wFelj0", "lastseen"=>"20140726004516", "page"=>"http://www.edutopia.org/blog/neuroscience-behind-stress-and-learning-judy-willis", "ogtitle"=>"The Neuroscience Behind Stress and Learning"}, {"domain"=>"foxnews.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406302244000", "h2"=>["Trending in Entertainment", "ON OUR RADAR", "AROUND THE WEB"], "h3"=>["How Jennie survived Beverly Hills", "McCarthy cousins at odds?", "Disney star's scary death threat tape", "Jennette: I'm no 'role model'", "Fifi lashes out about Peaches", "Radar Online", "Us Weekly", "Pop Crush", "TMZ", "Radar Online", "Dwyane Wade & Gabby Union -- Pre-Wedding Beyonce Concert", "Paris Jackson -- Reconnecting with Family ...

FOX411: All thanks to Jack Nicholson? ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Rob Reiner: Well, yes oddly enough when we were doing the press junket for “The Bucket List” everybody would ask us, what's on your bucket list? Whenever they asked Jack Nicholson that question he would say \"one more great romance,\" and that gave us the idea for this film. We thought it’s a perfect extension for the theme of “The Bucket List” which is, you live your life until it’s over, and if you’re lucky enough to find somebody later on in life and fall in love, don’t turn your back on it. FOX411: Love later in life -- how do you feel it differs? Reiner: I think it differs in that there's more at stake.  You know what's involved in falling in love. You know the pain that you might go through in either having it not work out, or going through a divorce, or a death.  In the case of “And So It Goes” Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton’s characters both have lost their spouses. So you know what's involved there. The stakes are just a lot higher. FOX411: It also addresses second chances across the board. Reiner: The main overarching theme is don't give up, don't give up on life. As long as you're alive, you have an opportunity to make good on relationships, on your work… we're living a lot longer now and with medical science advancing we'll have a hard time getting outta here... but you know, people are having second and third careers. So don't just say at age 65, I give up.  Find things that are interesting to you. It's all about the doing. FOX411: Is it right that you gave Michael the option to change the script because the one storyline may have hit too close to home with his character and his character’s son? Reiner: When we worked on the script the idea of Oren, Michael's character, being estranged from his son and his son having drug problems and ultimately having to go to jail that was something before we even knew Michael was going to do it. When we sent it to him we certainly were aware that this might be uncomfortable for him, but when he read it he said, no this is good, I'll play this, and he does. It's really good and it's very touching and tough for him to deal with but then he certainly knew what he was doing when he played those scenes. FOX411: Overall in terms of the marketplace and having films like this geared towards a different demographic, do you feel there’s a need for it? Reiner:  There's definitely an audience out there. We've discovered that with “The Bucket List”. We used to make the joke that of our core demographic audience, there was a 100 percent desire to see it with a 40 percent ability to get to the theater… but we know that if there's something there for this audience, we’re still the largest bulge of the population, the baby boomer generation… if there's something out there we'll go see it. So I think this works I think for that audience, but it works for anybody who wants to see a love story because I think they’re timeless and it’s the same awkwardness whether you’re a teenager or you’re an older adult in meeting somebody and getting together and having sex for the first time and all that. FOX411: I know you’ve done much more than romantic comedies, but what is some Rob Reiner filmmaking 101? Reiner: Well for me, I don't think of it in terms of elements because I just know how to tell the story from my experience and my observation and point of view of men and women. The way I look at it, whether it's “Flipped” 12 year-olds, college kids in “The Sure Thing”, or “When Harry Met Sally,” it’s young adults now older adults… I tell the same story basically. It's basically the way I view men and women. Women are just more mature than men, I don't care what age. They say girls mature faster than boys, that's not true… they are more mature than boys. No matter what age. So women are more in touch with their feelings, they’re more emotionally developed, they know what's important in life, and the men run around like idiots trying to figure that out until they meet a woman that can show them what's important. In the case of “And So It Goes” Michael Douglas has to meet Diane Keaton and he also has to meet this 10-year-old granddaughter that he didn’t even know he had to show him what’s important. FOX 411: Do you have fun when you’re thinking of the roles for yourself in these films? Reiner: Usually I don’t like to act in movies that I direct because it's kind of confusing, but in this case I had a very small budget and I had to get an actor who would work for scale, and I looked around and I found myself. Then the idea of playing a part where I get to wear a completely undetectable hairpiece… you can't walk away from that. FOX411: You can’t, it’s quite a look. Reiner: You didn’t notice right? FOX411: I couldn’t notice! Until you just said it! Reiner: Exactly see?

Sadly, his congratulatory sentiments to brother Dave Franco for coupling with Zac Efron – and the realistic looking screenshot of an article about the pair – was merely some sibling-on-sibling joking. Someone – and I imagine this someone to be a bored James Franco taking a break from Instagramming sleepy shirtless photos – fabricated a screenshot from a Hollywood Life headline. The original story was one about Z and his Neighbors co-star – I use the term loosely – Halston Sage . James captioned the photo, “Effron (sic) and My (sic) brother, dating!!!!!! Congrats, boys! I’m so happy for you!!!” In addition to the fact that it would be just too much attractive for one couple, you can tell the photo is fake because the author is “Dave Francock” (very mature, boys), and the text doesn’t quite match up. Tragically, Z is still pairing off with Michelle Rodriguez (ugh), and I’m no closer to a harmonious throuple relationship with both Zac and Dave. Equally tragic, for James anyway, is that Dave is basking in a spotlight that has temporarily turned away from his older brother. I think James knows he’s old news, and I think he’s pulling this sort of shenanigans in hopes that someone will pay him any attention. Sorry you’re the 5 minutes ago Franco, James, but please don’t toy with my emotions like this. It’s simply not nice, and I do hate when people are not nice.

We’ve compiled a list of things you can", "content"=>"Become an Irresistible Force What makes you attractive? If you ask the average Compass reader, he’ll probably say “dressing well.” But wearing custom tailored suits is not the only way to up your attractiveness. We’ve compiled a list of things you can do to increase your draw. Of course, there are a lot of things you can do to make yourself more desirable. What makes these five things special is that you already do them. Now, you just have to do them more often. More Haircuts The average guy waits until he needs a haircut. The best looking guys get to the barber before their mane needs taming. That way, their hair doesn’t go through wild mood swings. They don’t go from freshly shorn to normal to shaggy. They stay in the haircut sweet spot. This means committing to getting your ass into the barber’s chair on a regular schedule, but the results are well worth it. While we’re on the topic of regularly cutting hair, getting on a consistent shaving schedule is proactive too. A 2013 study showed that women find heavy (10-day growth) stubble and clean shaven equally physically attractive. Light (5-day growth) stubble scored lower in attractiveness. Moral of the story: the half-assed “I’ll shave every couple of days” system won’t do you any favors in the attractiveness department, thus hurting your chances of getting anyone to do you favors in…ahem…other departments. Compass readers already know that we’ve got you covered whether you’re like the clean shaven look or you’re more of a beard guy. And as long as we’re talking trimming, giving the rest of the body a once over to get rid of excess hair won’t hurt either. Waxing a hairy chest and/or back à la The 40-Year-Old Virgin may be a little extreme, but mowing down any stray hairs that try to make an escape from your nose and ears is a good idea. Just be sure to use the right tool for the job. Shine your shoes It’s no secret that women pay attention to their own shoes. For some reason, many guys seem to think the ladies give men a pass when it comes to footwear. Those guys are mistaken. A 2013 survey commissioned by Allen Edmonds revealed just how important shoes can be to your overall presentation. (Note: We are well aware of the fact that a survey commissioned by a footwear brand is probably skewed, but even if you account for a bit of bias, the results are still worth a look.) For starters, 64% of the women judged a man’s fashion sense by his shoes. Perhaps more tellingly, 52% of women said they judged a man’s personality by his shoes. What?! That’s right, women are checking out your kicks and deciding whether they think you’re a douche before you even say a word. Keep your shoes looking sharp. Shine your shoes regularly. Wear More Suits You don’t have to go all-out in a three-piece, pinstripe getup for all occasions, but dressing professionally will definitely improve your attractiveness. Why? For one, you’ll feel more confident (one of the most attractive traits in a man) in a suit. According to a survey conducted by a major suit maker, 92% of men said a makes a good first impression in professional situations. More importantly, 86% of men think that when a man wears a suit, he makes a good first impression in social situations, such as dates or parties. Justin is wearing the Charcoal Highbridge Houndstooth Suit Orpheus is wearing the Flatiron Blue Check Blazer Okay, so perhaps you’re skeptical about research coming out of a suit maker. But consider the study published in The Journal of Psychology in which women were asked whether they would engage in any type of relationship with a man (ranging from having coffee with a guy to marrying him) based on his looks. The men were dressed in a variety of outfits, including suits. The men who were dressed in suits consistently scored higher than the other guys when every other factor was equal. In other words, clothes may not make the man, but they certainly make an impression. Hold More Doors Chivalry is not dead it’s just largely forgotten. When it comes to chivalry a lot of men worry about coming off like a chauvinist. Those fears are unfounded. A 2013 British study found that more than four in five modern women welcome a man holding the door open for them and nearly two-thirds want a man to hold out a chair for them. You don’t need to go around laying your coat down on puddles so that women may step across but you can always work on your gentlemanliness. Try something simple like opening a car door for your date. It might be a first for you, and it’ll likely be a first for her too. That puts you in a whole different class than other would-be suitors. Read More Looks are great, but having something interesting to say will go a long way. Having a lifetime of rich experiences to draw on like that guy in the Dos Equis commercials is one way to be interesting. The rest of us will have to settle for an easier way of building up our reserves of interesting conversation, reading. You don’t have to read the classics of English literature. Just set aside a few minutes a day to reading something besides the scrolling ticker at the bottom of SportsCenter and work emails. Peruse a well-written magazine like The New Yorker until a headline grabs your attention. Read one article and you’ll feel like your IQ just rose 100 points.   BE MORE No one thing on this list will make you irresistible, but if you do a little more of everything on this list, you’re bound to see results.

Roethlisberger is about to enter the penultimate season of an eight-year, $102 million contract he signed before the 2008 season.      While Rooney is adamant about making sure Roethlisberger is a Steeler for the remainder of his career, putting something together in 2015 makes more fiscal sense than ironing something out before the 2014 opener against Cleveland.      Rooney pointed out a likely uptick in the salary cap next spring and Roethlisberger's own competitive desire as the main reasons behind the decision to wait.      \"Ben wants to be part of a winning team, to be in a position to compete for championships, and he understands that in order to do that we need to try to keep as many of the other players around as we can,\" Rooney said. \"So, addressing the players who are going into the final years of their contracts in 2014 makes sense.\" u local: Share your Steelers fan photos The Steelers signed All-Pro center Maurkice Pouncey to a six-year, $48 million deal at the end of minicamp in June. Several other players in the final year of their contracts, including outside linebacker Jason Worilds, could be in position for significant paydays.      Rooney approached Roethlisberger with the plan before Pouncey's contract was announced.      \"I think Ben understands that's our intention and the way we'd like to proceed,\" Rooney said.      The 32-year-old Roethlisberger has long maintained he'd prefer to spend his entire career in Pittsburgh. He shouted down reports of his unhappiness that surfaced last fall when the Steelers were mired in a 2-6 start.      Pittsburgh rebounded with a 6-2 record in the second half, averaging 28 points a game over the final seven weeks as Roethlisberger flourished as offensive coordinator Todd Haley expanded the use of the no-huddle.      Though the Steelers lost wide receivers Emmanuel Sanders and Jerricho Cotchery in free agency, Roethlisberger remains bullish after the team signed former New Orleans wideout Lance Moore, added hulking running back LeGarrette Blount and drafted 6-foot-4 receiver Martavis Bryant.      \"I want us to put a lot of points on the board,\" Roethlisberger said during minicamp in June.      Roethlisberger has a base salary of $12.1 million, with a cap hit of more than $18 million in 2014 when bonuses are factored in. By NFL standards, he may be underpaid. Matt Ryan, Colin Kaepernick, Jay Cutler and Tony Romo are on the list of quarterbacks - none of whom have won a championship let alone two - with more lucrative deals.      Not that Roethlisberger is much for comparing numbers. He quietly reported for his 11th training camp at Saint Vincent College on Friday and breezed through the conditioning test along with the rest of his teammates.      When jogs onto the field on Saturday for the team's first practice, he'll be joined by a sea of new faces, all of whom understand what they're facing after ceding the top spot in the AFC North to rivals Cincinnati and Baltimore.      \"There is a sense of urgency,\" Moore said. \"We know 8-8 is not what this organization is all about. This organization is about competing for championships and we're going to be willing to do whatever it takes to get back to that.\"      Including throwing young players onto the field immediately. Bryant and fellow rookies Dri Archer, Stephon Tulloch and first-round pick Ryan Shazier will be asked to make significant contributions, a marked departure from how the typically veteran-laden Steelers like to work.      Letting the kids take their time is no longer an option.      Asked if the staff will slow down installing the offense and defense to give the rookies time to get adjusted to life in the NFL, coach Mike Tomlin shook his head.      \"It's their job to catch up,\" he said.      NOTES: Safety Mike Mitchell and RB Alvester Alexander were placed on the Physically Unable to Perform list on Friday due to groin injuries. Tomlin expects both players to be out at least a week. ... OL Ramon Foster and P Adam Podlesh were excused from the conditioning test. Foster is dealing with a death in the family while Podlesh is awaiting the birth of his child.", "score"=>162.07994, "summaryTitle"=>"Roethlisberger extension will wait until 2015", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Art Rooney II says the Steelers are putting off a lengthy -- and certainly lucrative -- extension for Ben Roethlisberger so they can focus on improving their roster after missing the playoffs.", "cities"=>"us-pa", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.wtae.com/sports/steelers-ben-roethlisberger-contract-extension-wait-until-2015/27155882", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1mOaVEP", "lastseen"=>"20140726004601", "page"=>"http://www.wtae.com/sports/steelers-ben-roethlisberger-contract-extension-wait-until-2015/27155882", "ogtitle"=>"Roethlisberger extension will wait until 2015"}, {"domain"=>"itechnow.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406333426000", "h2"=>"Download imoji for iPhone", "h3"=>["Related Posts", "Follow Us!", "Recent Posts", "Follow Me!", "News Feeds", "Tags", "Contact Me!", "Pages"], "site"=>"itechnow.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004248", "keywords"=>"Download Apps, apps, download, downloads, apple, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, ios, itunes, imoji, download imoji, imoji for iphone,", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335368884", "title"=>"Download imoji for iPhone", "initial"=>"20140726001026", "summaryText"=>"iOS fans, do you want to change the way you chat with friends, we’ve got a new app for your iOS devices makes you able to turn any image into a custom sticker or emoji.

The 26-year-old joins Palace from Cardiff City where he scored nine goals last season in all competitions. Campbell was a product of the Manchester United academy, but only featured 4 times for the Red Devils, but also played on-loan for Spurs and Hull City.

Among the new actors and the characters they will portray are: Alexander Siddig as Doran Martell. Doran Martell is the ruling lord of Dorne and older brother to the late Prince Oberyn Martell. Unlike his brother, Doran is even-tempered and deliberate. Now, all of Dorne waits to see how their lord will react to his brother’s death. Toby Sebastian as Trystane Martell. Trystane Martell is Prince Doran’s son and heir to Dorne. His father betrothed him to Myrcella Baratheon as part of the alliance offered by Tywin Lannister, then Hand of the King. Nell Tiger Free as Myrcella Baratheon. Myrcella Baratheon is officially the eldest child of Cersei Lannister and the late King Robert Baratheon, though in truth her father is Cersei’s own brother, Jaime Lannister. For years, she has been a guest and ward of Prince Doran, betrothed to his son, but her position has become tenuous with the death of Oberyn Martell, the Prince’s brother. DeObia Oparei as Areo Hotah. Areo Hotah is the long-serving captain of Doran Martell’s palace guard, renowned for his loyalty and his longaxe. Enzo Cilenti as Yezzan. Yezzan was an extremely wealthy slave trader before Daenerys Targaryen outlawed the slave trade. Jessica Henwick as Nymeria (“Nym”) Sand. Nym Sand is the second eldest of the late Prince Oberyn’s bastard daughters. Her mother was an Eastern noblewoman who brought Nym up to be cultured, graceful and deadly with a whip. Rosabell Laurenti Sellers as Tyene Sand. Tyene Sand is the daughter of the late Prince Oberyn Martell by Ellaria Sand, his final paramour. Tyene is fiercer than she looks, especially with her twin daggers. Keisha Castle-Hughes as Obara Sand. A fearsome warrior, Obara Sand is the eldest bastard daughter of the late Prince Oberyn Martell. Her mother was a Dornish peasant girl who caught the eye of the late Prince. Jonathan Pryce as the High Sparrow. A devout and pious man, the High Sparrow came to King’s Landing to serve those forgotten by much of the world – the poor, the downtrodden and the infirm – and quickly amassed a large following. His fellow believers have swarmed over the city, ministering to the lowest and decrying the corruption of the highest. Based on the bestselling fantasy book series by George R.R. Martin, GAME OF THRONES is an epic drama set in the world of Westeros, where ambitious men and women of both honor and ill-repute live in a land whose summers and winters can last years. The Emmy®- and Golden Globe-winning fantasy series concluded its ten-episode fourth season in June, with the fifth season scheduled to launch in 2015. Siddig’s an actor that has been touted in the past—prior to season 4, he was a common suggestion for Oberyn Martell, and I think he’ll do very well as Prince Doran. Other named cast members a collection of younger, less well-known actors such as Nell Tiger Free and Toby Sebastian, and more established performers such as DeObia Oparei (it will be interesting to see if Areo Hotah remains Norvoshi or if, like Xaro Xhoan Daxos and Salladhor Saan, is given different origins), Enzo Cilenti (playing a much slimmer Yezzan, we expect, than the original character) and (most notably) Jonathan Pryce as the High Sparrow. These are not going to be all the named roles cast this season, but they are most of the significant ones, at least. Possibly some roles scheduled for filming later this year—filming has commenced, it should be noted—may well be revealed later, but for the most part the above are going to be the chief new additions for this season.

We’ve plucked out a handful of noteworthy replies. It’s inevitable that you’ll disagree with some of what you’re about to read, because these folks are coming from all different angles. If you feel like you need to counter their perspectives, keep it civil. If anyone gets nasty on these folks, we’ll hire some Russian computer hackers to drain your bank accounts.  AC Will: The vitriolic public response to the Kendall Jones photos certainly provokes some interesting questions about our complex relationship with other animals–most acutely those relating to our use of them. I think it’s clear that a large proportion of people (across all cultures) approve of the harvesting of animals for certain purposes; but this acceptance almost always comes hand-in-hand with varying levels of reverence, respect and affection for those same animals. From indigenous hunters to contemporary conservation non-profits (some of which you mentioned in your article), this superficially paradoxical reaction to our own desires and practical necessity for animal use seems instinctual. With that in mind, I think much of the hatred directed towards Kendall and other trophy photo pariahs could be partially explained by a subconscious discomfort with the incongruity present in these photos. Though I don’t doubt her very real respect for the animals in her photos, the ear-to-ear prom night grin just doesn’t display any of this respect to the viewer. I also get that she’s understandably pleased about her successful hunt, but none of that context is accessible to the viewer, either. Of course, we all have a natural preclusion to smile in photos–it’s how we’re socialized from a young age to respond to someone pointing a camera in our faces–but it may be worth considering how our ancestors presented themselves in photos with their kills. To quote a recent Facebook post from the Boone & Crockett Club, “[the ultimate field photo] shows the hunter, the habitat, and the animal. Most importantly it conveys a deep respect for the animal and a degree of solemness for what took place.” Here is the photo in question: ( http://tinyurl.com/nebcvb4 ) Would the fiasco related to Kendall Jones have taken place if she’d conveyed the same level of solemnity as Mr. Phillips in the above photo? I don’t know, but I imagine it would have mediated the vitriol. Just something to consider. Tom in Oregon: Very reasoned comments Steve. I got to go to Africa last year. Hunting, fishing and sightseeing. The hunting was fenced and non-fenced. The fenced area was a 60,000 acre ranch. Both to keep poachers out and the critters in. I considered it fair chase. I harvested my Blesbuck and zebra there. The “open hunt” was driving for miles upon miles, spotting then stalking. I got my impala and warthog there. The warthog was after two days of sitting in a makeshift blind near a waterhole for two days. Loved every minute of it. Burning elephant dung like incense to mask our scent. We were allowed to help with skinning, cutting and cooking. Wouldn’t have had it any other way. I’m going back. This time to Mozambique to a friends 900,000 acre concession. No fences.  It’s like stepping back in time 100 years. If you go, try the blue wildebeest, it’s about the best meat I’ve ever tasted. RKamimura: I figured you would post something about this. I have no comment on the subject mainly because i know very little on hunting in Africa. The social media has been buzzing about the subject and to tell you the truth, I am rather tired of it and as a result, taking a break from Facebook because the comments on both sides of the coin have been rather nasty and malicious. I live in CA (Ironically, Facebook is not far from where I live) and I also hunt. Also, I have friends who are vegetarian and also so-called animal lovers. These friends also know I hunt, but we all understand each other. Though our opinions may differ, we mutually respect one another. As a result, I never post any pix of the game right after the hunt on Facebook. I do post pix of me cooking the game because we all share a common connection which is food. I feel if I do post pix posing with game right after the hunt, its more ‘in your face’ to people who never experienced or grew up hunting and it would be hard to get supporters in what you do (especially in CA). Plus, IMO if you post any pic or have a ‘eye catching caption’, the viewer’s initial thoughts/impressions/biases/prejudices start kicking in. The viewer is not going to take the time to read the ‘dissertation’ following it no matter how well written it is. Therefore, I take a more subtle approach to hunting with my friends and people I know: show them the end product at the dinner table and explain the story on how it got there. Anyway, thats just me… Samuel Fang : With respect, there are sometimes specific animals within an endangered species that need to be culled. That’s just how things work. An old male lion that’s been ousted as the head of a pride is *dangerous* to other lions. He will kill the baby lions of a pride in an attempt to become the new head of that pride. His continued existence, after years of breeding, is a *detriment* to the species’ genetic diversity. And genetic diversity is the name of the game in conservation. In that situation, that lion needs to be culled for the good of the species. So would you rather have a ranger get paid $2 to kill that lion with a rifle or have some tourist pay $50k to kill that lion with a rifle? Because that’s the real choice in the situation. Assuming the rangers aren’t corrupt (and these are men who regularly risk their lives and turn down bribes to protect these animals), we’re talking about a lion that would be killed shortly anyway, to PROTECT the species. At least make some money off of it, so the money can be spent protecting that lion’s progeny. Erik Sarmiento : Take a look at India. It has a ban on trophy hunting, and still we are loosing the tiger and the leopard. Why? Poachers. With no flow of cash the Indian government must invest in rangers, money that could easily be paid by hunters. No creature has ever gone extinct with a regulated hunting season. Emphasis on REGULATED and SEASON. Mike Hitch : I have mixed feelings on this one. I FULLY support the right to hunt and even the need for it to control animal populations. However, I am somewhat old school where I think hunting should be a true sport and we should use ourselves what we kill. In other words, I tend to not be impressed when anyone including this young lady use ultra modern weapons to kill from long distances and then post a picture and abandon the meat. I am more impressed by the huntress who used the bow for the kill but I have a feeling that the entourage of assistants and guides that always attend these high dollar hunts, made sure she was never in harms way. To me that is not a “hunt”, that’s just a cowardly taking of a majestic beast’s life! And I do understand the conservatism of it all or if the lion were a mortal threat to the people directly, but it seems there might be better ways to do that as well. Just another example IMO of how man is not such a good steward of Mother Earth. In the end, it doesn’t matter what I think however and so I don’t fret over it! Team410: I’ve been to Africa 3 times for photo safaris.  I have a masters degree in wildlife biology.  I am a hunter and eat what I kill.  I don’t have the words to say how I detest such photos of smiling people over the animals that they have killed, especially animals that won’t be eaten such as predators.  I understand the economics of the hunt, as well as the economics of non-consumptive activities.  Lions have severely declined in Africa over the last few decades and to have pics like these are inexcusable, pathetic.  Perhaps the lions were fenced in…nonetheless, pathetic.  This kind of hubris is what makes me sick about segments of the “hunting community.” Denise: Bearing in mind that you are an authority on hunting, I found your reserve to previously decline comment on a topic because you lack experience was very respectable and true to your character.  It is refreshing to know that a person can remain himself in the midst of great success and exposure.  That being said, I found it perplexing that you would then so flippantly comment on something you do have absolutely “no great authority”.  In two sentences you reduced the equal rights movement to the level of gluten intolerance. Considering the fact that sexism, in regard to hunting, has been a topic of at least one other article that I am aware of and that you decided to lead with it in the Africa article, the subject is obviously on your radar.  I am wondering why you choose to preface the issue with, what is essentially, an apology for bring it up. The women in this country deal with sexism on a daily basis.  It is inescapable.  Consider the pay gap, the glass ceiling, the deficit of women in STEM and tech fields, the harassment of the ones that are there, little representation in government, the Supreme Court, female medical cost, inadequate female medical research, treatment of rape victims, unprocessed rape kits, objectification in the media… I could go on but I think that is a good representation of why the word gets “thrown” around as much as it does.  And that just touches on what American women have to deal with.  The situation for women in other parts of the world is far graver: rape as warfare, child marriages, stoning, honor killings, genital mutilation… It is my opinion that the woman’s movement is at a standstill (maybe backward, if you consider the Tea Party agenda) and the only way to push forward, to break the glass ceiling is through men.  Men of intelligence, influence, exposure to stand up for women (for our daughters) and acknowledge that sexism exists.  You are obviously aware of the attitudes toward female hunters and the reasons; it isn’t that far of a stretch that those are the same justifications for keeping women out of the corner office.  We both hope our daughters will have the world at their feet but it will take men like you, men with a voice in the media to say, “I have a daughter of my own, and I hope like hell that she becomes hardcore hunter and the CEO of a company and I pray that the attitude of others won’t make her hard because of it.”   Tags: africa hunting controversy , big game hunting , kendall jones , melissa bachman , reader responses Leave a Reply You must be to post a comment.", "score"=>161.9296, "summaryTitle"=>"Reactions to the African Big Game Controversy Article", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Our piece of commentary on African big game hunting inspired some spirited debate among our readers.

A further 26 per cent chose not to answer “which may stand as a proxy for admission of use,” Forum noted . Even the president of Forum Research, Lorne Bozinoff, isn’t buying it. “We pride ourselves as Canadians on our open‐mindedness, but even with the anonymity guaranteed by the IVR survey method, it would appear there is substantial under‐reporting of pornography use. While uncommon among females, certainly, it must be assumed that more than one quarter of Canadian males have encountered pornography in the past year,” he said in a press release. Those who did answer in the affirmative were more likely to be young (27 per cent), male (26 per cent), wealthier (22 per cent), have no religious affiliation (23 per cent) and hail from Atlantic Canada (21 per cent) or British Columbia (20 per cent). Curiously, Green Party supporters were more likely to be pornography users and those with children were slightly more likely to indulge than the childless (18 vs. 15 per cent). The interactive phone survey was conducted on July 18 and asked 1,624 randomly-selected Canadians 18 years about their pornography viewing habits , starting with “We are going to ask a series of very personal questions. If you’d prefer not to answer, just press 9.” Those who didn’t press nine offered some interesting insight into what Canadians do when they have idle hands and an internet connection. These results should probably be taken with a grain of salt since they only represent 169 (don’t giggle) people — 140 men and 29 women. Of the people who said they have viewed of purchased pornography in the last year, 26 per cent were male and just six per cent were female. Men were also slightly more likely to decline an answer (27 vs. 24 per cent). Conservative supporters were the least likely to admit to pornography use, at 14 per cent compared to 23 per cent of Green Party supporters. Unsurprisingly, evangelical Christians were the least likely to say they had and also the most likely to firmly say they had not used pornography rather than just saying they prefer not to answer. Of the male pornography users, 43 per cent said they watched it once a week or more whereas the majority of women said they only watched it once a year or less (29 per cent) or every few months (38 per cent). Again, Green Party supporters were the most frequent users, with 56 per cent of those saying they do watch pornography indulging once a week or more. Pornography watching is mostly a solo venture for Canadians, with 62 per cent saying they only ever watch it alone. Fourteen per cent said they watch with someone else and 12 per cent said they did both. Women were more likely to say they watched it with a partner as opposed to by themselves. Forum didn’t ask participants what their sexual orientation is, but it did ask what genders they like to see on the screen. The majority, 56 per cent, like heterosexual pairings while eight per cent prefer men only and 18 per cent only wanted to see women (mostly men, go figure). Broken down by political preferences, Conservatives strongly preferred heterosexual pairings and women only as opposed to nothing but naked, sweaty men. Of all those surveyed, including those who said they don’t watch porn, 52 per cent were in favour of laws requiring internet providers to block pornography or require an opt-in requirement. Again, Christian Conservatives were the mostly likely to favour these laws, as were women. A full half of respondents agreed that pornography is harmful to society, ranging from just 39 per cent for those age 18 to 34 all the way to 70 per cent among those age 65 or older.

Suspicions toward Utada Hikaru’s Italian husband’s news of unemployment The 7/23 web version of “Josei Jishin” is reporting that Francesco Calliano, who married Utada Hikaru in May of this year, had already lost his job as a bartender at the time of the wedding ceremony. Even though Utada urged the press to refrain from releasing information about the wedding, at the private ceremony the press came out in full force. The media of her hometown attacked her for the end result, saying “Utada didn’t accept everyone.” On her side, a complete guard against the mass media was put up, but after that a surprising development was revealed. According to the article, Francesco worked as a bartender at the hotel, but retired from the job without taking proper time off for the wedding. For now, it seems like he has a plan to open a Japanese restaurant in London. “Just by it being reported to the media in her hometown that ‘A normal young man marries a Japanese superstar,’ the qualitative differences between them is evident. On the net, the reception of the news of his unemployment includes statements of doubt about her spouse such as “He could have coordinated his time off with the wedding ceremony” “Just as was expected, they’re living a gigolo lifestyle” “Wasn’t Utada his main source of income?” ” – Entertainment Writer Also, in the issue of Josei Jishin sold on the 15th, it was stated that the new residence they are both living in has a monthly rent of 45,000 yen (roughly 4,400 USD or 2,600 pounds). To the songstress this is but a modest new marriage lifestyle, but with the cost of opening a restaurant, it is probably valid to think that Utada’s finances will be the main source of funding for that as well. “Her ex-husband, Kiriya Kazuaki was not only a movie director and producer, but he is also a celebrity who inherited Pachinko business from his family. It has been stated that the reason for their divorce was “a lack of communication,” but because the status of her current spouse is “down and out,” it is being said within the entertainment world that this is a marriage being lead solely by Utada. It is also being said that just like Hamasaki Ayumi, who has experienced various trials in love that ‘She [Utada] is treating her husband like a pet.’” -Entertainment Writer (same as previous) Without being concerned with such opinions, the couple spent last month in New York.

A CNN/ORC International poll released Friday morning also indicates that a small majority of Americans do not believe that Obama has gone too far in expanding the powers of the presidency. Earlier this month, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the GOP's 2008 vice presidential nominee, called for Obama's impeachment, becoming the latest voice on the right to make the suggestion. But according to the poll, only 35% want Obama impeached, with nearly two-thirds saying the President should not be removed from office. There's an obvious partisan divide, with 57% of Republicans but only 35% of independents and 13% of Democrats backing a move to impeach Obama. \"Anti-impeachment sentiment is roughly where it was for past presidents -- 67% opposed Bill Clinton's impeachment in September 1998, and 69% opposed impeaching George W. Bush when a few Democrats began talking about it in 2006,\" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. \"One reason may be that Americans take impeachment very seriously. Only about one in five say that impeachment is a valid response if Congress is dissatisfied with a president's policies or the way he is handling his job. Nearly eight in 10 say impeachment should be reserved for high crimes and misdemeanors,\" Holland adds. The poll's release came one day after the House Rules Committee approved - along a party line vote - a resolution authorizing Speaker John Boehner's lawsuit against the President. The GOP controlled House is expected approve it next week. Boehner and House Republicans plan to sue Obama over his health care law. They claim he violated the Constitution by circumventing Congress and changing the law's employer mandate on his own. By a 57%-41% margin, Americans say House Republicans shouldn't file the suit. As with the question on impeachment, there's a wide partisan divide over the lawsuit. When it comes to expanding the power of the presidency, has Obama gone too far? Forty-five percent say yes, with three in 10 saying the President's actions have been about right, and 22% saying he hasn't gone far enough. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International from July 18-20, with 1,012 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.

Tupac dropped one of the most memorable quotables on the subject during an  interview  in 1995,  “I love women, but I hate bitches.”  Let’s be real: Most women get offend by the words “bitch,” “hoe,” and “groupie.” However, despite the negative connotations and their frivolous usage, the words have a proper place. For rap stars as big as ScHoolboy Q , the word ‘groupie’ can equate to nightmare. TDE is known to be a playfu l  camp of pranksters, and the jokes on the road can get pretty intense.

Random Flip Work Feature 5689 words by Hanna Hurr on Fri, Jul 25 2014 Steve Klabnik. Photo by author. — By Hanna Hurr “My job is to go kill the theory bison and then drag its carcass back so that everyone can eat it.” When Steve Klabnik walks onto the back patio of Fritzl's Lunch Box in Bushwick to join Tyler, Gregg, and I around a rickety table, it's as if we already know each other. In a way, some of us do. The way you can know somebody from the Internet. But Steve also carries himself with welcoming assurance. He's wearing his typical outfit: a black hoodie and skinny black jeans. The mohawk that used to get him confused with Skrillex is gone. He sits down resolutely, responding to Twitter with one hand, ready to be bombarded by questions both from us and his followers. Steve is one of the world's leading Ruby on Rails committers. Last year, he made over 1400 public contributions (“Wow, I've been slacking off, it used to be 2300”) and is the 200th most active GitHub user . He has built numerous Ruby Gems, and works as an educator for several projects. He taught programming at Jumspstart Lab . He's spoken at countless conferences around the world , and recently started working for Mozilla to produce documentation and the original tutorial for the less-known programming language Rust . Ruby on Rails, or Rails for short, is an open source web application framework which runs on the Ruby programming language. If you've visited Basecamp, Hulu, Scribd, Slideshare, Funny or Die, GitHub, or Twitter in the early days, you've used web applications built with Rails. The software that powers Mask Magazine is also built with Rails. Besides being a prolific programmer, Steve is an outspoken anti-capitalist and Deleuzian who reads lots of philosophy. For example, he published the text “ Deleuze for Developers ”. Yesterday, he launched a new blog exploring the intersection between philosophy and technology: metaphysics.io . Being a public figure in the tech world and advancing a public political agenda is uncommon among most programmers, so it's not surprising he often finds himself in heated Twitter arguments. Accordingly, while we order food, Steve's phone lights up over and over with notifications. What's today's Twitter controversy? “I’m caught up in this argument on Twitter with a bunch of people. It's about whether you need to study theory to become a programmer. People only see the first half of the problem. Yes, you don't need to study theory to become a programmer, that's not what I'm talking about. To make a terrible analogy: nobody expects plumbers to have a physics degree but they do have to know some things about water physics, and that can be learned in a way that doesn't necessarily involve getting a physics degree. And that is super cool, totally valid, and not a problem. But that doesn't mean that physics degrees are bullshit or even not useful to plumbers.” How do you like Brooklyn? Brooklyn is amazing and wonderful. New York City in general is. I've learned that I need variety, and you can definitely find that here. It's kind of a country of it's own. At some point, Bloomberg said that if the NYPD was an army, it would be the 7th largest army in the world. [Turns out it wasn't true,] but in a certain sense, that’s the scale of New York — it’s massive. I often pick a new neighborhood and just go to work out of different coffeeshops or parks. I realized they don't turn off free wifi when the stores close so I've sat outside of Macy's on 34th St at like 4:30 AM programming away, because why not? Steve is originally from Pittsburgh, PA, and admits that, technically, he started coding at age 7. But he doesn't really want to talk about that. I kind of shy away from that fact because it perpetuates this bad stereotype. There's this weird fetishization of young people who are good at programming and who end up being programmers. The programming I did from age 7 to 22 is worth the same amount of time as the programming I did from 22 to 24. One year during that time period isn't qualitatively the same as one year of time in my adult life. I know a lot of people who started writing code in college who are really good programmers. How did you become interested in philosophy and anti-capitalist theory? I've always enjoyed intellectual stuff and been a theory-inflected person. But I started taking that more seriously when several personal events in my life eventually led to me being an anti-capitalist. My anti-capitalism is intrinsically tied to my interest in theory. I was raised republican and Catholic and never thought critically about it. I like to joke that libertarians are republicans who met a gay person they actually liked. I became a libertarian in college when I made some gay friends. I also almost married this girl I went to high school with and she left me for someone in World of Warcraft. At that point I decided that I needed to reevaluate my life. Laughs. When I came to think about it, I realized that I'd only ever assumed that all these things I thought of the world were true, because they were told to me and I never bothered to question them. So I decided to be a hard core libertarian. The very first instance that led to me to becoming an anti-capitalist was that I was reading some stuff and had this epiphany. I thought, the fundamental problem of the world is defintely the accumulation of wealth; that's totally a problem, and libertarians should figure out how to fix that. I didn't really understand what a big idea that was. I'd never read any Marx or anything like that. I was totally ignorant but semi-independently I decided that that was the problem. Our grilled cheese sandwiches arrive. So then the G20 came to Pittsburgh, and I went to it. I didn't really know what the G20 was, but the fact that people felt the need to fight cops over it meant that it was probably a big deal. As a libertarian, I vaguely didn't like the cops already. Because I'm a nerd, I dressed like this. Steve points at his clothes. All black. I had no idea that the black bloc was a thing, and I showed up to a G20 event dressed for the black bloc. Little idiot me. Did the other kids recognize you as a friend? Yeah, kind of. On the second day, an illegal march happened. I showed up and saw a bunch of college kids gathering. I watched as the cops started lining up on one side of the park, then I watched them line up on the other side of the park, and I realized it was getting bad. Suddenly I get a tap on the shoulder, and these four women from the bloc were standing there: ‘Hey, where's everyone at?’ I thought: me?! I don't know anything! I was looking for all of you! They were like, ‘This is bad, we gotta get out of there.’ So we left, but a bunch of other kids got arrested. I ended up being one of the first American citizens to have a sound canon aimed at me. The first time they used it outside of Iraq was on me . And tear gas, and rubber bullets, and all those other things. At the time, I didn't really agree with all the people waving their anti-capitalism flags, but I had never really considered capitalism to be anything but ‘the way the world works’. These people cared about this enough to get shot at by cops. I figured I should probably try to understand their arguments — even if I disagreed with them — just to make sure that I understood why they cared so much. I was also into ‘citizen journalism’ at the time. So I was tweeting about where stuff was going on — reporting from the ‘citizen’s perspective’, or whatever. I ended up befriending this English professor who was also active on Twitter at the time. This was in 2009 — Twitter was a lot smaller then. I ended up meeting up with her, and she always managed to recognize when I was saying something ... ‘pro-capitalist’. Instead of telling me to get out, she was like: ‘why don't we read the books together?’ Were you in college then? I dropped out of college, actually. I ended up finishing my undergrad later, but I would have been a senior in college at the time. I dropped out to launch a startup, that's what I was doing. So the English professor told me, ‘Here's what we're gonna read: Nietzsche, Foucault, and Marx.’ So I stumbled through all of those. Eventually I realized that Marx was saying all these things I had been thinking independently. And I thought, ‘well, I guess capitalism is bad’. And I've been on that side of things ever since. Oftentimes people pretend they've always thought the way they think now. They don't even want to admit that they once had different opinions. Oh yeah. I advocated tons of things that were completely, ethically abhorrent during different periods of my life. This is one of the reasons why I'm so scared of them keeping data on everything. There is one person who specifically pulls things I said in my past and tries to make me look shitty with them. And it sucks. I'm not for those things anymore. For most people, that's called growth and change. But it's called ‘inconsistency’ by jerks. [Tyler:] Eventually, as this public data record builds on the web, I think that people will care a lot less about somebody's record in terms of consistency over time. Everybody will know what it's like to have been naïve in public. Yeah, but there's going to be a lot of pain and suffering before then. In a generation or two that might be true, but I'm going to be dead by then. After doing more and more reading, I actually tend to identify more as a communist than an anarchist. Which a ton of anarchists consider treacherous bullshit. Honestly, I mostly roleplay being a communist, because it's so shocking to most people. I don't actually believe existing communist movements are the way forward, but it's much easier than trying to explain Deleuze and Guattari's views on identity, and so on. That's one of the reasons the United States is so fucking reactionary, we don't have any real Left here. The anarchist movement is so fractured and fragmented. Most people don't experience regular old boring interactions with people who are genuinely Left. I enjoy roleplaying a more traditional extreme lefty. I also know the counter-arguments well enough because I've made them myself in the past. I grew up in Finland and moved here in 2009. The absence of the Left here surprised me. Many of my friends at home see themselves as ‘non-parliamentary leftist’ or just proper leftists and not anarchists. There's just a much stronger tradition of economic critique and analysis. The anarchist tradition is not as strong there, it's more rootless. [Tyler:] And the State also permits so much less interesting things for youth to do here. In Europe, the State gives grants for social centers, consequently people develop political goals that don't really involve confrontation with the State. They end up being more traditional Left even if they believe they are further out. Whereas here, if you want a scene, it has to be a DIY scene. You can even take it back to the foundations of the country, when a bunch of rich people were sick of paying taxes. Like, that's what it was. That's why we're a country. The Fourth of July just happened, and it's one of the two days of the year when people get the most upset at me on Twitter. What's the other day? Christmas. I hate christmas. And Fourth of July. Christmas more, Fourth of July ... a little less. My parents have always told me, ‘never lie to anyone’. It backfired on them when I decided all their ideas were wrong. When my mom emailed and asked me where I was going to watch the Fourth of July fireworks, I told her, ‘Mom, the only thing I can think of is a hundred thousand dead women and children in Iraq, and millions of dead Native Americans, and tons of terrible things all over the world. So I don't see any reason to go watch the fireworks, I'm sorry.’ That kind of attitude usually means people get real mad at me on Twitter. Last Christmas I tweeted ‘Happy lie to your children about a man breaking into your house last night day’. People got really upset. I have a friend who went through this problem with their kids. She has decided not to lie to her children as a categorical rule, so when Christmas started to become a thing and her kids asked her about it, she told them, ‘OK, we need to keep a secret together, because you're going to get me in so much trouble. This is going to sound totally crazy, but all the other parents lie to their children about this man breaking into their house and leaving presents, and it's stupid, it's not real. All the kids are gonna tell you it's real, but one day they'll grow up and find out that it's not real and it's gonna be a giant problem.’ So of course her kids went and told the other kids, and all these parents told her she was a shitty parent. But how was she a shitty parent? She wasn't lying to her kids. She was like, ‘these are human beings who are relying on you for everything in their entire existence. You're fundamentally violating their trust, how am I the fucked up person in this relation?’ It's funny seeing it like that. Of course it sounds crazy to a kid, but I don't remember having that broken to me. When my partner found out that Santa Clause wasn't real she was like, ‘Oh, God's not real either! ’ and her parents were like, ‘– no, no. That's totally true’, and she's like, ‘eeeh, I'm not going to be fooled by you twice!’ When did you decided to move to the West Coast? I lived in Pittsburgh almost my entire life. I was actually supposed to move here when I went to California, but then I tweeted ‘I'm moving to Brooklyn because I wanna leave Pittsburgh and I don't know where else I should go, and I like Brooklyn, so what's up?’ And my friend said, ‘I really need a roommate in Hollywood,’ so I changed my flight and went out there, to the Farmhouse. What's the Farmhouse? The TL;DR is that my house is a website, farmhouse.co . Back in the day, Los Angeles used to be a bunch of farms. Hollywood had avocado groves, and the Farmhouse is a house in Hollywood that survived since those days, it was literally a farmhouse. It's this old house and a two-story tall avocado tree. It's a very stereotypical punk house — some people are kind of living there, kind of not, and some are there to work on various projects. It's great. I eventually had to leave because I was running out of money. I had been doing work that was primarily open-source, and that meant I was taking a salary that was OK in Pittsburgh, but when I moved to LA rent took 50% of my income. I couldn't afford to stay and keep doing that job, so I chose the job. Having accelerated rapidly through his career as both a programmer and an outspoken political voice, making tough adjustments along the way, I can't help but wonder if Steve has moved from place to place as a way of purging old selves. I imagine Steve ends up being a token anti-capitalist among programmers and a token programmer genius among his political friends, and that he's become such a charismatic diplomat as a result of always being at work for one side or the other. How do you work? When I quit my last job to return to contracting, I jokingly told my old CEO that I would like to disassociate all time and space requirements from what I need to do. I don't really have a typical work week. I will work a ton some day, and not at all for a little while, or switch between projects and do different things. Sometimes I find myself in other countries last minute — that has happened several times. I travel a lot, to speak at conferences but also because I like moving around. I have to live by my calendar, I don't know what day it is half the time. I made it here on time because my phone buzzed an hour ago telling me to go here. Is that a result of being somebody who works in code, or is it your natural inclination? Living under capitalism is stressful; it demands that you sell your labor-power on some sort of hourly or salaried basis to someone else. That just doesn't work for me. This last job I had was a nine-to-five job [at Balanced that] I took to see if I could handle it. I lasted six months. And I got actually, for-real depressed. They're awesome, it's not a problem with them. I'm used to living this way. The job I had before Balanced had no formal job requirements. Once you experience that freedom it's really hard to give it up. People always tell me I'm super productive and I always feel really lazy. I know that by most objective measures I produce a lot, but right now I know I have 8 emails I'm supposed to answer in my inbox, and I was supposed to write something earlier this week, and I have a lot of other things I'm trying to do that are not done yet, so ... [Tyler:] Most people have hundreds or even thousands of unread emails, and they know they have maybe a hundred in there that are really important, so they're afraid to even look at it. Eight's not that bad. People fantasize about eight unread emails. Some people are into the Getting Things Done methodology. Tyler and I have our phases with it for different stretches of time, and it plays a big role in how we organize our work. I've read all of those books. It's as if to get something done without the drive to be a good worker, you need to boss your future around sometimes. You have to implement all these systems just to know when you're working and when you're not. I always try to tell other people this, and to remember it myself: productivity is a capitalist measure of value. Fetishizing productivity is really harmful, because who decides what is productive? What type of labor is and is not productive is an inherently political question. Most of the time, the answer to questions about how to be a better worker are essentially about how to make more money. So I think there's a bit of danger in being all pro ‘lifehacking’. For me it was more that I started to hurt people I cared about because I didn't show up to their thing. Or, I scheduled brunch with two people at the same time. So I just made myself keep a calendar because I recognized that I was being an asshole. It's not like I was trying to be one, it's just that I was being scatter-brained and it didn't work. The only thing I do productivity-hack-wise is I turn all email notifications on, and then use Gmail filters super aggressively to keep them out of my inbox. The only thing that hits my inbox are new or unique emails. Rust gets about 200 to 300 emails a day from GitHub. None of those ever hit my inbox, they go in my Rust folder and I check it a couple of times a day. I'm super email-focused and use email as a todo-list. It's not really anything formal, I just try to keep on top of it as much as possible, and doing a little bit often keeps it from becoming unmanageable. You've become a big advocate for Rust, and you've started working for Mozilla to produce documentation. What excites you right now about the future of your career? I like Rust for a number of different reasons. Mostly, I see it as a natural next step for me. I've come to understand that my function is to go read all of the weird theory stuff and write all the secondary literature that applies the theory in a way that people can understand. If I make Rails better, and a lot of people make a lot of rails apps, my influence is amplified. That's why I've enjoyed doing educational work as well. I was into education, because I realized that if I can teach a new programmer every day, and they go do stuff, the result is way more code than I would ever be able to write myself. That's why I'm excited about Rust. Rust is specifically taking advantage of lots of ‘new’ computer science ideas. It's called Rust because there are no new ideas in it. But the funny thing is that the industry is so backwards that our mainstream programming language technology is literally 40 years old. Ruby's garbage collection technology was described in a paper in 1968. The newest thing in Rust comes from Cyclone, which had its paper published in 2001 or something. So by building the best programming language that the year 2000 had to offer we are far, far ahead of what other people are doing. And it's bringing more and more of the theory that is useful into the hands of regular everyday programmers. For example, the person who made the idea of ‘null pointers’ called it ‘my billion dollar mistake’, and Rust eliminates the concept of null pointers altogether. You can only eliminate that concept by adding in a bunch of theory of linear and affine type systems, which is, whatever, theory. The point is there's some theory you don't really need to understand to get the benefit of that theory. So Rust is bringing these ideas that are newer than what most other languages use, to a wider and more mainstream audience. There are some other languages that are doing that too, but Rust has the right timing, backing, community, and buzz to be successful. I'm basically picking it because I believe it's already destined to be a winner. And maybe you can play a part in it becoming a winner? Yes. I'm writing the introductory tutorial right now, and so if Rust replaces C++, my words will be explaining systems programming to every new systems programmer for however long that is. It starts raining, so we pack our stuff and move inside. Steve orders a limeade. This is a terrible analogy: but like hunting, my job is to go kill the theory bison and then drag its carcass back so that everyone can eat it. That's what I'm good at. So that's what I'll be doing, whatever I happen to be working on. I really liked how you used Deleuzian concepts as a way to help startups and organizations understand the value of openness at your keynote at the API conference . I'm wondering, do you promote Deleuzian concepts because you find them intrinsically good, or as something we must adopt not to be eaten alive by conglomerates? This is the ultimate question of the Left, right? I don't necessarily know what to do. In the sense of Deleuze, specifically, it's more that I enjoy the result of thinking about the world through his eyes. I think that's useful in and of itself. Even if it means that we are building systems that aren't necessarily ‘the best’. I do think that capitalism will collapse. I do think that we need to do something to get it to collapse. But I don't know what that something is. I don't think that means you should do nothing . You should do a bunch of stuff and see what happens. I don't have any sort of grand master plan, I'm just trying to do things I think are good. A lot of it involves bending these organizations. For example, as a publicly traded company, Twitter is ultimately problematic, but if I can get them to be a little bit open... It's almost like harm reduction. I'm not trying to help Twitter become a better capitalist entity, I'm trying to help them harm less people, while they're doing what they're inevitably going to do anyways. You blog quite a lot. What role does your blog play in your life and work? I've had a number of different blogs, and as I told you I'm starting a new one. For me, blogging is a way of recording stuff I want to save for later, and/or working through an idea. I've written technical blogposts and then a year later googled and found my own blog post, and been like ‘Thank you, past me!’ Regarding the more political stuff, it usually starts with an argument I've made in conversations several times, and then decide to make a blog post out of. That way I can just point to the post instead of repeating myself. If I've made the argument a couple of times, it's probably good enough for the blog. So it's a way for me to record my thoughts and avoid regurgitating myself over and over. But a certain amount of regurgitation is good because that's how you develop ideas. Who reads your blog? There's an inverse proportionate relationship where more people like the technical stuff, but people who like the political stuff like it more , there's just a lot less of them. When I write about Deleuze and programming, I know five people who will get super jazzed about it, but we are the five people. But when I write some stupid post about Ruby, a few thousand people read it. I've had people ask me to silo off different kinds of content, that they only want to hear what I have to say on programming and stop talking about your politics. But I've refused to do that. Our phones beep: flash flood warning. The rain starts falling heavier outside. First of all, you can't separate those two, and secondly, that's on purpose. I will write lots of boring technical posts so that people subscribe and have to at least click through some Lefty propaganda they wouldn't otherwise read. It kind of goes back to me playing the communist. I think there's something valuable in personalizing it. One of the things that’s hard about real-world activism is the social expectations we've developed in the activist community which say that if you talk about an action you went to, you're probably a cop. And that's a good thing, but it also means that we have no way of communicating these situations to other people. I decided that I'd rather talk about situations that I've been in previously as a means of personalizing them. When I tell people that I was hit by a sound canon by cops, they now know someone that it actually happened to. When they see those things happen on the news it's not some abstract person, it's me in a way. I think that's useful. What are you reading right now? Or what are some texts that have been important to you? I should be reading Capital by Pickety right now. I finally got a copy, and because he states his conclusions so early upfront, I read the first three pages and I was like, ‘do I want to read these 700 pages? No. I already know what your point is and what you'll end up saying.’ I just finished What is Philosophy by Deleuze and Guattari. It's the last thing they ever wrote together, and it's sort of their model of what philosophy is. Which is to create concepts. It's not a love of concepts, it's concept creation . I'm taking a small hiatus from reading right now to finish up a lot of my writing. So I'll start reading again in a month or so. But I think that anybody who considers themselves vaguely Left should read either the first three chapters of Capital Vol. I or Wages, Price and Profit , which is the same idea but a little easier to digest. I really love Ursula K. Le Guin. Especially The Dispossessed , which is one of my favorite books ever. And The Left Hand of Darkness . It starts pouring outside. Wow, maybe this flood warning was not totally ridiculous. I live in a basement so LOL. Last question: what do you think about the future of open source? Open source is a mega-capitalist conspiracy to reduce programmer wages. In the 80s, there was this thing called the free-software movement, and that was about the ethics of software; making software free had nothing to do with money but with ethics . Other people came along, and they removed the ethical aspect of it and made it solely about the monetary aspect. The free-software ethos and the founders of the open-source movement are mega-racist libertarian people, and so it's always really weird to me that a bunch of Leftists are so into open source; it explicitly manifests capitalist social relations. With that said, I think there's a bright future for open source, because it's yet another method to drive down costs. They can earn more money off of the stuff that we produce. Like, I still have $52,000 in student debt, and I've made a bunch of people super rich — the same is true for everyone who lives under capitalism, but for me it's very acute because I've worked on all these open source projects. The other day, I was hanging out with two people and there was somebody using a jackhammer outside where we were. I said, ‘Nobody asked the jackhammer dude to work on an open jackhammer project on Saturdays, that would be totally absurd.’ But that's what we do. Programmers as a class systematically devalue their own labor, doing it for free without even being asked to. It's not universally bad — it's really cool that you can get all this software for free. But, value is being generated from your labor and it's not being captured by you, and that’s unsustainable. I’m only able to do open source work now because I'm getting a real salary from Mozilla. They're a one-of-a-kind organization that can afford to pay people for open source stuff, that's their entire mission. But the whole world can't work for Mozilla. Having an open source portfolio has become a job requirement. We're self-selecting the people who are willing to work for nothing and giving them a leg up in the employment process, which has all sorts of detrimental effects in skewing the population of who's a programmer and who isn't. Totally, like the internship economy. Exactly. If you come from a good-off family and you can afford to not work for a year to take an unpaid internship, then you get a job. Super similar to that. But programmers have zero class consciousness. If the American proletariat does not have a class consciousness, programmers have negative class consciousness. We even acknowledge that people fuck us over all the time and then do absolutely nothing about it. And we actively harm the attempt to fix the problem. If you mention the word union around programmers, they start frothing at the mouth. But people complain about their boss sticking them over all the time. That would be such a great story. Programmers unionizing. Workers of the world, \"Hack the Planet\". It's a hard argument to make because being a programmer is a relatively well-paid profession, so when I tell people ‘You should be paid more than $150,000 dollars a year like you currently are,’ they're like, ‘You sound greedy.’ No, the point isn't whether you’re making enough money or not. The point is that you're making millions of dollars to your bosses. The reason you can get paid so well is because there's lots more up there .

This is not without reason, as it’s an antiquated and mostly unnecessary tool from an era of text-based input that has long passed. But there still are some commands that remain useful, and Windows 8 even added new features. Here are the commands every Windows user needs to know. In case you’re not sure how to access the command prompt, forgot basic commands, or would like to know how to see a list of  switches for each command, you can refer to our beginners guide to the Windows command line for instructions. ASSOC Most files in Windows are associated with a specific program that is assigned to open the file by default. At times, remembering these associations can become confusing. You can remind yourself by entering the command “assoc” to display a full list of file extensions and the programs they’re connected with. You can also extend the command to change file associations. For example, “assoc .txt=” will change the file association for text files to whatever program you enter after the equal sign. The ASSOC command itself will reveal both the extension names and program names, which will help you properly use this command. You can probably do this more easily in the GUI, but the command line interface is a perfectly functional alternative. Cipher Deleting files on a mechanical hard drive  doesn’t really delete them at all . Instead, it marks the files as no longer accessible and the space they took up as free. The files remain recoverable until they’re overwritten with new data, which can take some time. The cipher command , however, can be used to wipe a directory by writing random data to it. To wipe your C drive, for example, you’d use the command “cipher /w:c”, which will wipe free space on the drive. The command does not overwrite undeleted data, so you will not wipe out files you need by running this command. There’s also a host of other cipher commands, however, they are generally redundant with Bitlocker enabled versions of Windows. Driverquery Drivers remain among the most important software installed on a PC. Improperly configured or missing drivers can cause all sorts of trouble, so its good to have access to a list of what’s on your PC. That’s exactly what the “driverquery” command does. You can extend it to “driverquery -v” to obtain more information including the directory in which the driver is installed. File Compare This command can be used to identify differences in text between two files, and is particularly useful for writers and programmers trying to find small changes between two versions of a file. Simply type “fc” and then the directory path and file name of the two files you want to compare . You can also extend the command in several ways. Typing “/b” compares only binary output, “/c” disregards the case of text in the comparison, and “/l” only compares ASCII text. So, for example, you could use the following: fc /l \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\example1.doc\" \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\example2.doc\" to compare ASCII text in two word documents. Ipconfig This command relays the IP address that your computer is currently using. However, if you’re behind a router (like most computers today), you’ll instead receive the local network address of the router. Still, ipconfig is useful because of its extensions. “ipconfig /release” followed by “ipconfig /renew” can force your Windows PC into asking for a new IP address, which is useful if your computer claims one isn’t available. You can also use “ipconfig /flushdns” to refresh your DNS address. These commands are great if the Windows network troubleshooter chokes, which does happen on occasion. Netstat Entering the command “netstat -an” will provide you with a list of currently open ports and related IP addresses . You’ll also be told what state the port is in – listening, established or closed. This is a great command if you’re trying to troubleshoot the devices your PC is connected to or you’re afraid you’re infected with a Trojan and are trying to locate a malicious connection. Ping Sometimes, you need to know whether or not packets are making it to a specific networked device. That’s where ping comes in handy. Typing “ping” followed by an IP address or web domain will send a series of test packets to the specified address. If they arrive and are returned, you know the device is capable of communicating with your PC; if it fails, you know that there’s something blocking communication between the device and your computer. This can help you decide if an issue is caused by improper configuration or a failure of network hardware. Pathping This is a more advanced version of ping that’s useful if there are multiple routers between your PC and the device you’re testing. Like ping, you use this command by typing “pathping” followed by the IP address, but unlike ping, pathping also relays some information about the route the test packets take. Tracert The “tracert” command is similar to pathping. Once again, type “tracert” followed by the IP address or domain you’d like to trace. You’ll receive information about each step in the route between your PC and the target. Unlike pathping, however, tracert also tracks how much time (in milliseconds) each hop between servers or devices takes. Powercfg Powercfg is a very powerful command for managing and tracking how your computer uses energy. You can use the command “powercfg /hibernate on” and “powercfg /hibernate off” to manage hibernation, and you can also use the command “powercfg /a” to view the power-saving states currently available on your PC. Another useful command is “powercfg /devicequery s1_supported” which displays a list of devices on your computer that support connected standby. When enabled, these devices can be used to bring your computer out of standby – even remotely. You can enable this by selecting the device in Device Manager, opening its properties, going to the Power Management tab and then checking the “Allow this device to wake the computer” box. “Powercfg /lastwake” will show you what device last woke your PC from a sleep state. You can use this command to troubleshoot your PC if it seems to wake from sleep at random . The “powercfg /energy” command can be used to build a detailed power consumption report for your PC, which is output to a directory indicated after the command finishes. This report will let you know of any system faults that might increase power consumption, like devices that are blocking certain sleep modes, or which aren’t properly configured to respond to your power management settings. Windows 8 added “powercfg /batteryreport”, which provides a detailed analysis of battery use, if applicable. Normally output to your Windows user directory, the report provides details about the time and length of charge and discharge cycles, lifetime average battery life, and estimated battery capacity. Shutdown As of Windows 8/8.1 there is now a shutdown command that – you guessed it! – shuts down your computer. This is of course redundant with the already easily accessed shutdown button, but what’s not redundant is the “shutdown /r /o” command, which restarts your PC and launches the Advanced Start Options menu, which is where you can access Safe Mode and Windows recovery utilities. This is useful if you want to restart your computer for troubleshooting purposes. System File Checker System File Checker is an automatic scan and repair tool that focuses on Windows system files. You will need to run the command prompt with administrator privileges and enter the command “sfc /scannow”. If any corrupt or missing files are found, they’ll be automatically replaced using cached copies kept by Windows for just that purpose. The command can require a half-hour to run on older notebooks. Recovery Image Virtually all Windows 8/8.1 computers ship from the factory with a recovery image , but the image may include bloatware you’d rather not have re-installed. Once you’ve un-installed the software you can create a new image using the “recimg” command. Entering this command presents a very detailed explanation of how to use it. You must have administrator privileges to use the recimg command, and you can only access the custom recovery image you create via the Windows 8 “refresh” feature . Tasklist The “tasklist” command can be used to provide a current list of all tasks running on your PC. Though somewhat redundant with Task Manager , the command may sometimes find tasks hidden from view in that utility. There’s also a wide range of modifiers. “Tasklist -svc” shows services related to each task, “tasklist -v” can be used to obtain more detail on each task, and “tasklist -m” can be used to locate .dll files associated with active tasks. These commands are useful for advanced troubleshooting. Taskkill Tasks that appear in the “tasklist” command will have an executable and process ID (a four-digit number) associated with them. You can force stop a program using “taskkill -im” followed by the executable’s name, or “taskkill -pid” followed by the process ID. Again, this is a bit redundant with Task Manager, but may be used to kill otherwise unresponsive or hidden programs. Conclusion This article doesn’t cover every Windows command available. There are literally hundreds of them when all variables are included. Most, however, are no longer useful because they’ve been replaced by more convenient menus in the Windows GUI or simply aren’t commonly used (telnet, for example).

One of the few times in modern life that couldn’t be tampered with, pregnancy demanded that a rushed populace listen to nature. But now women can schedule the birth of a child rather than wait for nature to determine when labor begins, so it shouldn’t be surprising that celebrities have popularized the notion of elective Cesarean section . To wit, the pop star Victoria Beckham, also known as Posh Spice, who inspired the phrase “too posh to push” after she chose to give birth via C-section. This perceived desire to shorten the duration of pregnancy has become so great that the March of Dimes launched a public awareness campaign that encourages women to carry their pregnancies to term. Past generations would marvel that our culture needs a campaign to influence women on how long to stay pregnant. Related: Do All 40 Weeks Matter? When the outside world defines the pace of pregnancy, the mother-fetal relationship changes. Women used to dream about their future babies; now they can pay for a personalized 4-D ultrasound experience to see the emerging features of a child. Parents can evaluate the relative health of their baby, learn its approximate weight and, earlier than ever before, know its sex. Thanks to the widespread use of ultrasound, most obtain a representation of their baby before holding the physical being. And it’s not just ultrasound that has opened up the womb to public view. The internet, cellphones and digital cameras encourage people to document pregnancy closer than ever before. Social media permit an expectant couple to share their pregnancy and joy with distant families and even strangers. Traditionally a time of internal connection between mother and child, pregnancy has now become an externalized process that involves others. The public has become a voyeur during what was once a private time for a woman and her fetus. Pregnancy used to be a period of preparation and reflection. Before the 20th century, the physical risks of childbirth compelled women to consider the very nature of their own survival. As risks diminished, women still wondered how impending motherhood would impact their social and biological reality. But now that pregnancy is seen as its own phase of life, with so many things to do and products to buy, less time is available to ponder the impact of motherhood. Inevitably, parenting feels like a shock when compared to the attention that was showered on pregnancy. Related: The Rewards of Motherhood With the increasing societal celebration and public focus on pregnancy, there is pressure on women to be happy from the moment of conception. But as pregnancy is relished, less attention is paid to resources devoted to the mother post-birth . The journey to motherhood still requires reflection—and even moments of solemnity—if only because it involves the loss of a more carefree stage of life. As technocratic culture constantly seeks new efficiencies, pregnancy should remain a refreshing change of pace, one that cannot be altered.  Excerpted from A Womb with a View: America’s Growing Public Interest in Pregnancy   by Laura Tropp (Praeger, 2013)", "score"=>161.63376, "summaryTitle"=>"The Case for a Slower Pregnancy", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"From the downside of scheduling C-sections to social media overload, Laura Tropp makes the case for a more reflective pregnancy", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.fitpregnancy.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/case-slower-pregnancy", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1jZUpqA", "lastseen"=>"20140726004623", "page"=>"http://www.fitpregnancy.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-health/case-slower-pregnancy", "ogtitle"=>"The Case for a Slower Pregnancy"}, {"domain"=>"kcra.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406332847000", "h2"=>"Coroner's office says woman was not pregnant", "h3"=>"From the web", "site"=>"www.kcra.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004631", "keywords"=>"US", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335591702", "title"=>"Man shoots, kills burglar who yells 'I'm pregnant!' | National News - KCRA Home", "initial"=>"20140726000047", "summaryText"=>"Tom Greer says he fought back when he was attacked by intruders at his Southern California home.

Police say the couple beat and threw the elderly man to the ground, causing him to suffer a broken collarbone, cuts and bruises. Despite his injuries, Greer managed to grab his gun and fire at the suspects, causing them to flee through the garage and into the alley, police said. In an interview with non-CNN affiliate KNBC, Greer said that as the suspects ran into the alley, Miller yelled, \"'Don't shoot me, I'm pregnant!

When asked by KNBC how he felt about the incident, Greer responded that he had no regrets. \"I had to do what I had to do.\" The male suspect fled the scene, according to Greer and Chief McDonnell.

Rand", "content"=>"Spasm of legislation would allow medical pot 'federalism' and reduce possession penalties. A new bill from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., would reduce the likelihood of life in prison for pot brownies. By Steven Nelson July 25, 2014 | 2:45 p.m. EDT Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is seeking to blaze a path for marijuana reform in the Senate with legislation that would officially legalize state medical marijuana programs and whittle away at federal drug possession penalties. On Wednesday, the likely 2016 presidential candidate introduced an amendment to explicitly allow state medical marijuana regimes. On Thursday, he proposed a stand-alone bill that would lower federal penalties for repeat marijuana possession offenses and reform how law enforcement calculates the weight of drugs in baked goods. “It is Rand Paul laying down his marker on this issue,” a senior Paul aide says of the medical marijuana amendment. The underlying bill, the “Bring Jobs Home Act,” is unlikely to become law, but Paul wants to force colleagues to reveal their position on medical use of the drug. National polls show overwhelming support for legal medical marijuana. CBS News gauged support at 86 percent in January and Fox News found 85 percent support in February 2013. Several national polls in 2014 have found majority support for outright marijuana legalization. [ RELATED: Rand Paul's Urban League Message ] “There’s no way to make any progress on this issue until the Senate takes a vote and the American people can know where their senators are,” the Paul aide says. “That’s the reason to file amendments to every bill that comes up – there might be an opportunity to force a vote and put the Senate on record.” In a surprising May 30 victory for marijuana reformers, the House of Representatives  voted  to block the Drug Enforcement Administration and federal prosecutors from going after medical marijuana in states that allow it. Paul and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., announced June 19 they are sponsoring a companion amendment in the Senate, which has not yet come up for a vote. The newest Paul medical marijuana amendment would go a step further by explicitly allowing states to legalize and regulate medical marijuana “[n]otwithstanding section 708 of the Controlled Substances Act … or any other provision of law.” Marijuana is currently an illegal Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. Though the Justice Department generally tolerates medical marijuana in nearly two dozen states and recreational pot markets in two others, it’s still possible for patients, growers and middlemen to fall victim of DEA raids and prosecution by hard line U.S. attorneys. [ EARLIER: DOJ, DEA Silent After Stunning House Pot Vote ] Four family members and a family friend – jointly nicknamed “the Kettle Falls Five” – are currently facing federal charges  after roughly complying with Washington state’s medical marijuana law. Paul’s stand-alone drug reform bill filed Thursday, officially the Reclassification to Ensure Smarter and Equal Treatment (RESET) Act of 2014, would lower simple marijuana (and other drug) possession penalties for second- and multiple-time convictions from a maximum two years and three years, respectively, to one year in prison – eliminating the accompanying felony classification – and would lower maximum fines to $1,000. The bill would also ban using the total weight of baked goods as the standard for prosecuting illicit edible makers. Earlier this year a Texas teenager who baked marijuana-laced brownies was slapped with felony charges that bring up to 99 years in prison. He's charged with possessing 1.5 pounds of the drug, but his attorney says about 7 grams went into the brownies. \"In determining the weight of a controlled substance or mixture of controlled substances that is in compound with a food product for purposes of this title or title III, the weight of the food product shall not be included,\" the proposed RESET Act says. [ MORE: Former GOP Governor Looks to Build the 'Microsoft of Marijuana' ] \"This is the latest in a long line of sensible drug policy reform proposals from Sen. Paul,\" says Marijuana Majority Chairman Tom Angell. \"Most political observers assume he's setting himself up to run for president and, if that's true, this is more evidence that it's quickly becoming the new conventional wisdom that working to end the failed war on drugs is smart politics.\" See Photos Editorial Cartoons on Pot Legalization Paul has sponsored or co-sponsored several other bills that would soften harsh drug penalties. He's a long-standing supporter to rescinding mandatory minimum sentences and restoring voting rights to ex-felons. Earlier this month he co-introduced with Booker the REDEEM Act, which would allow adults a path to sealing nonviolent criminal records. The senator intends to sponsor a more comprehensive bill that would reschedule marijuana, allowing doctors to write prescriptions in lieu of current doctor “recommendation” systems, the Paul aide says.

The article was straightforward, not particularly inspired writing, and communicated things that were obvious if you knew anything about Charlie Strong.  It wasn't really even insider information, though the context of its release was given that it occurred in private player meetings.  It outlined the Culture Change that was coming to Texas.  We didn't know Strong, so it was interesting to us. We know him better now, don't we? With six players  - two starters and two significant role players - dismissed in the last 24 hours (and more on the way), I thought revisiting it might be particularly relevant.  The last two paragraphs were a pretty solid foreshadowing of what's going down right now: Some of the players still don't understand that Strong's message was specifically to them . Brown's last years were focused on talking about things with no follow up. He was also absent from the team constantly and had little read on the mood or culture of the locker room.  Some players may still be under the impression that this is more chatter with no follow through.  They're in for a rude awakening.  Their bad habits are about to be brought to light. ** We'll have some transfers.  Some of them will be good players - some may even excel elsewhere.  Any school teacher will tell you it's easy to start the year as a harsh disciplinarian and then ease up as you gain trust, but it's nearly impossible to start weak and then try to regain control.  Some players simply won't be able to handle the new world. The Texas players didn't know Strong either.  They thought this was more Mack Chat.  Now they're starting to learn. No one is exempt.  There's nowhere to hide.  Action rules over talk. Strong identified the bad apples early (and bad fruit takes many forms for Strong - it's not just about legalistic rule-breaking, it's about comportment and character), put them on highly supported, easy-to-follow academic, disciplinary and character-building plans and monitored them over several months, both directly and through his proxies in the staff, S&C and academic support.  Folks who are all aligned with Strong.  No place to hide.  No coach to smooth things over for you, because he wants you starting for his position group.  Strong's assistants are a united fist.  Good luck trying to find a finger to twist. Along the way, he administered surprise drug tests (beyond NCAA standards), forced players to meet with tutors daily, followed up on their commitments and mercilessly tracked down and confronted dishonesty or laziness. Parents were brought up to speed and every bit of bad action was brought to light.  It was up to the player to change. The tools for that change were laid at their feet.  They simply had to cast down their bucket where they were. The bizarre thing is, by most college football team's standards, we're on the good side of the bell curve.  The things Strong won't tolerate are offenses many coaches made peace with years ago.  Some out of mercenary interest, some of out pure exhaustion.  Some live in simple denial. For Strong, this isn't just about football.  He's trying to change a culture that he despises that has a grip on far too many young men.  These aren't frivolous dismissals.  Nor is it a power trip.  Trying to change how Texas plays football is secondary to his main mission: changing how his players approach life.  He believes doing the latter will lead to long-term success in the former. Can changing lives, even at the cost of short term football success, get him enough wins to stick around and change more?  We're about to find out.  Share Share with Longhorns friends", "score"=>161.48982, "summaryTitle"=>"What The Hell Is Going On?

To promote Bitcoin, the committee currently focuses on producing best-practice guides that members of the general public can turn to for information about Bitcoin and its potential. In this post, we would like to share with you how the committee is creating those guides with an eye towards its decentralization and its opening to the community. We have created a series of guides with an  introduction to Bitcoin , and we provide suggestions on  selecting a wallet , buying bitcoin ,  using bitcoin in business and the  technical part of bitcoin for non-technical users . You can also see a few of our proposals and the committee’s  social media presence . Those proposals are made to the Board of the Foundation from time to time. All these materials are created in an open-ended way and everybody is free to participate at any time. The committee has been using Github.com for content hosting, content generation, task management and credit attribution. The goal is for all content created by the committee to be hosted on Github, all editing to be done there, all tasks to be public and, most importantly, membership and standing in the committee to be determined by contribution. Committee membership is not determined by a decree and nobody chooses whom to appoint in the committee. There is a chair-person, currently Nikos Bentenitis, who is pushing towards this vision and is encouraging everybody to participate. But the idea is that if this experiment in decentralized content creation succeeds, there will be no need for a chair-person. People in the committee come and go, ideas gain and lose momentum but with Github everybody’s work is visible to the world. We invite you to look at the committee’s  Github repository , outstanding  tasks (called issues on Github), and current  contributors . And we encourage you to set up a Github account and to contribute to the committee’s work  by updating our guides, sharing them with your network and translating them (we have done some work in Spanish and Italian but we need more languages). And finally, the committee has an expanding social media presence with members sharing the credentials of social media accounts and posting there.

Gone are the command-and-control days of executives managing by decree. Today businesses are run largely by cross-functional teams of peers and populated by baby boomers and their Generation X offspring, who show little tolerance for unquestioned authority. Electronic communication and globalization have further eroded the traditional hierarchy, as ideas and people flow more freely than ever around organizations and as decisions get made closer to the markets. These fundamental changes, more than a decade in the making but now firmly part of the economic landscape, essentially come down to this: work today gets done in an environment where people don’t just ask What should I do? but Why should I do it? To answer this why question effectively is to persuade. Yet many businesspeople misunderstand persuasion, and more still underutilize it. The reason? Persuasion is widely perceived as a skill reserved for selling products and closing deals. It is also commonly seen as just another form of manipulation—devious and to be avoided. Certainly, persuasion can be used in selling and deal-clinching situations, and it can be misused to manipulate people. But exercised constructively and to its full potential, persuasion supersedes sales and is quite the opposite of deception. Effective persuasion becomes a negotiating and learning process through which a persuader leads colleagues to a problem’s shared solution. Persuasion does indeed involve moving people to a position they don’t currently hold, but not by begging or cajoling. Instead, it involves careful preparation, the proper framing of arguments, the presentation of vivid supporting evidence, and the effort to find the correct emotional match with your audience. Effective persuasion is a difficult and time-consuming proposition, but it may also be more powerful than the command-and-control managerial model it succeeds. As AlliedSignal’s CEO Lawrence Bossidy said recently, “The day when you could yell and scream and beat people into good performance is over. Today you have to appeal to them by helping them see how they can get from here to there, by establishing some credibility, and by giving them some reason and help to get there. Do all those things, and they’ll knock down doors.” In essence, he is describing persuasion—now more than ever, the language of business leadership. Think for a moment of your definition of persuasion. If you are like most businesspeople I have encountered (see the insert “Twelve Years of Watching and Listening”), you see persuasion as a relatively straightforward process. First, you strongly state your position. Second, you outline the supporting arguments, followed by a highly assertive, data-based exposition. Finally, you enter the deal-making stage and work toward a “close.” In other words, you use logic, persistence, and personal enthusiasm to get others to buy a good idea. The reality is that following this process is one surefire way to fail at persuasion. (See the insert “Four Ways Not to Persuade.”) What, then, constitutes effective persuasion? If persuasion is a learning and negotiating process, then in the most general terms it involves phases of discovery, preparation, and dialogue. Getting ready to persuade colleagues can take weeks or months of planning as you learn about your audience and the position you intend to argue. Before they even start to talk, effective persuaders have considered their positions from every angle. What investments in time and money will my position require from others? Is my supporting evidence weak in any way? Are there alternative positions I need to examine? Dialogue happens before and during the persuasion process. Before the process begins, effective persuaders use dialogue to learn more about their audience’s opinions, concerns, and perspectives. During the process, dialogue continues to be a form of learning, but it is also the beginning of the negotiation stage. You invite people to discuss, even debate, the merits of your position, and then to offer honest feedback and suggest alternative solutions. That may sound like a slow way to achieve your goal, but effective persuasion is about testing and revising ideas in concert with your colleagues’ concerns and needs. In fact, the best persuaders not only listen to others but also incorporate their perspectives into a shared solution. Persuasion, in other words, often involves—indeed, demands—compromise. Perhaps that is why the most effective persuaders seem to share a common trait: they are open-minded, never dogmatic. They enter the persuasion process prepared to adjust their viewpoints and incorporate others’ ideas. That approach to persuasion is, interestingly, highly persuasive in itself. When colleagues see that a persuader is eager to hear their views and willing to make changes in response to their needs and concerns, they respond very positively. They trust the persuader more and listen more attentively. They don’t fear being bowled over or manipulated. They see the persuader as flexible and are thus more willing to make sacrifices themselves. Because that is such a powerful dynamic, good persuaders often enter the persuasion process with judicious compromises already prepared. Four Essential Steps Effective persuasion involves four distinct and essential steps. First, effective persuaders establish credibility. Second, they frame their goals in a way that identifies common ground with those they intend to persuade. Third, they reinforce their positions using vivid language and compelling evidence. And fourth, they connect emotionally with their audience. As one of the most effective executives in our research commented, “The most valuable lesson I’ve learned about persuasion over the years is that there’s just as much strategy in how you present your position as in the position itself. In fact, I’d say the strategy of presentation is the more critical.”", "score"=>161.2667, "summaryTitle"=>"The Necessary Art of Persuasion", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Business management magazine, blogs, case studies, articles, books, and webinars from Harvard Business Review, addressing today's topics and challenges in business management.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://hbr.org/1998/05/the-necessary-art-of-persuasion/ar/1", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "direct", "bit.ly", "twitterrific.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1lEiEWy", "lastseen"=>"20140726003846", "page"=>"http://hbr.org/1998/05/the-necessary-art-of-persuasion/ar/1", "ogtitle"=>"The Necessary Art of Persuasion"}, {"domain"=>"cbs6albany.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406324256000", "h2"=>["Hot Topics", "Trending", "Social", "Most Shared", "RSS Feeds", "More Top Stories", "Related Stories"], "h3"=>["Entertainment News", "Get This", "Business News", "Consumer Info", "Science/Tech News"], "site"=>"www.cbs6albany.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004224", "keywords"=>", Former contractor sentenced 3 to 9 years in prison, CBS6 Channel 6 News :: News - Top Stories in and around New York State top stories, Albany, Saratoga Springs, Schenectady, Troy, New York, NY local news, WRGB, Channel 6, Local News in Albany, cbs6albany.com, CBS 6 Albany, New York State, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335344222", "title"=>"Former contractor sentenced 3 to 9 years in prison - WRGB CBS6 - Top Stories", "initial"=>"20140725213736", "summaryText"=>"Updated: Friday, July 25 2014, 04:47 PM EDT ALBANY - A contractor who stole thousands of dollars by taking on contractor jobs, and not finisheing the work learned his sentence on Friday.

There were tears and sighs and a pint of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, but in the end, it was all for naught as Eddie decided to turn down a role on the series Dallas to stay in Los Angeles, close to his wife and two young sons. The news of this Dallas role came early in the episode, the morning after the couple enjoyed a romantic dinner cooked by a private chef at their Malibu mansion while Eddie's kids were with their mom, Brandi Glanville . The couple like to stay in for date night when they can it seems rather than go out and be hassled by the paparazzi invading their public space, as Eddie explained to the reality TV crew that was filming the entire evening. The next morning, Eddie dropped his Dallas bombshell as LeAnn got ready for a day out with her girls. Eddie was not sure he wanted to commit to the seven month shoot as it would take him away from his kids. LeAnn also worried about Eddie being away from his kids for such a long period of time, but seemed more upset she would have to be away from him for weeks at a time as he filmed alone on set thousands of miles away. We wonder why ? In the end, the producers offered Eddie some three-day weekends and paid travel to fly back and forth to L.A., but he still turned the role down. He gave LeAnn the news as she sat drunkenly eating Ben & Jerry's ice cream in their kitchen after a night out at a gay country bar that culminated with the singer belting out her 2000 hit \"Can't Fight the Moonlight,\" which you can watch above. After getting the news, a very emotional LeAnn said, \"Really, are you okay with that? The last thing I want is for you to be resentful of the situation.\" She then added, \"I know you need to feel fulfilled, you love what you do and it breaks my heart to see that you have to compromise as much as you do to be honest.\" And with that, Eddie said other roles will come along, grabbed his crying wife in his arms, and announced he was going upstairs to have his way with her.

I'll close with a", "content"=>"About two weeks, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella penned a detailed memo to Microsoft employees , a mission statement of sorts, outlining the company's vision and strategy for the future. Upon reading the memo, along with a subsequent interview Nadella conducted with The Verge, I was struck by the fact that Microsoft still doesn't get it. As Microsoft continues its push to remain relevant in the mobile space, it still doesn't appreciate the factors that allowed Apple to enter a market they had no previous experience in and turn it on its head with the iPhone. Arguably blinded by the profits brought in by its Windows monopoly and its suite of productivity software, Microsoft still doesn't seem to fully comprehend how the iPhone was able to push established players like RIM to the brink of irrelevancy in just a few years. As an illustration, here is Nadella's response to a question from Joshua Topolsky regarding Microsoft's strategy to sell more devices to consumers. You're defining the market as \"It's already done, Apple and Google have won, because they won the consumer side.\" And I'm going to question that. I'm going to say \"No, any thinking consumer should consider Microsoft because guess what, you're not just a consumer. You're also going to go to work, you're also going to be productive and we can do a better job for you in there.\" And that's what I want to appeal to. And therein lies the problem. Consumers primarily buy mobile devices that make their lives easier and more fun, work be damned. Microsoft Office wasn't available on the iPhone until June of 2013. An iPad version wasn't released until four months ago! And guess what, hundreds of millions of consumers bought iPhones and iPads anyhow. The longer Microsoft continues to focus on the alleged allure of productivity software, the more it runs the risk of falling into the same trap as RIM, which remained so beholden to the notion of physical keyboards that it completely ignored the mass market to placate its beloved enterprise users. Just as RIM mistakenly believed that physical keyboards could fend off the growing popularity of the iPhone, Microsoft seems to believe that the abstract notion of \"productivity\" will help them garner more marketshare. The underlying problem with this train of thought is that it ignores the fact that the iPhone helped usher in the consumerization of IT, the dynamic where individuals themselves are able to influence the type of mobile devices supported in their work environment. I witnessed this myself back in 2008 when the IT department at the company I worked for tried, for as long as it could, to delay official support for the iPhone in the face of growing employee demand. By the time 2009 rolled around, the IT department simply couldn't ignore the ever increasing number of iPhone-toting employees (and executives) demanding iPhone support. Despite what Microsoft may believe, most consumers, when purchasing a smartphone, are not expressly looking for a device that makes them more efficient at work. Contrast Apple's notion of productivity (taking photos, editing movies, content creation, and sure, a little bit of word processing etc.) with the example Nadella relayed to The Verge. So that's the core of the memo, and when I think about productivity for me, a good canonical example for us is what we are doing with Cortana. Think about what Cortana can do for you as a salesperson, walking out of a sales meeting. It knows your calendar so it knows which company and person you met, where you were because of the geofencing, it does your \"CRM\" work for you as opposed to just about getting you there in terms of your mapping information. So it's about a much more broad view of what an intelligent agent that we can produce [is] that can reason over data, that's personal, organizational, and [can] improve productivity. Nadella expresses over and over again the notion of dual-use devices, which to me seems to indicate a clear lack of focus I don't think of the world as enterprise and consumer. I think of it as people. In fact, I call out the specific thing about dual-use, which is I think where we can be most unique. Look, there's always going to be Pandora on our devices. But what is it that we can do with our operating systems, with our cloud, with our software, which is different and unique? We can make OneDrive, and OneDrive for Business, which I will use to share photographs and save photographs for my business documents. We can do a fantastic job of bringing those things together in support of you, the individual who's spanning both personal life and work life. So to me, that's what we are about. It's hard to read that and think that Microsoft is really able to distinguish the needs of the average consumer from those of an enterprise customer. It's why the bulk of Microsoft's Windows Phone and Surface advertisements tend to focus on the most boring of use cases. I can use Excel on my Surface to be productive? Yawn. And check out this ad for Windows Phone. Note what's most prominently displayed; Microsoft Office. Sure there's a market for tablet and smartphone productivity software, but targeting those features to mainstream consumers surely elicits nothing but yawns and glazed eyes. And again, it also ignores why the iPhone was able to become so successful. Because Office is responsible for such a huge percentage of Microsoft's revenue, the company has never faced the fact that for most people, applications like Word and Excel are necessary evils that they tolerate or are indifferent to (at best) in order to get work done. And yet, these are the use cases Microsoft continues to drone on and on about. The iPhone demonstrated that people want to do work on the devices that entertain them. Microsoft's strategy is seemingly the opposite; telling consumers that work-oriented Microsoft devices can also be used for entertainment. Nadella's memo mentions how Microsoft views each individual as a \"dual user\", yet the selling points Nadella makes for Microsoft products seem to wholly ignore the needs and interests of the average consumer. We will think of every user as a potential \"dual user\" – people who will use technology for their work or school and also deeply use it in their personal digital life. They strive to get stuff done with technology, demanding new cloud-powered applications, extensively using time and calendar management, advanced expression, collaboration, meeting, search and research services, all with better security and privacy control. It's almost painful to read. Who goes into a store looking for a smartphone with great time and calendar management? Apple understands that many of these business-oriented features are important, but it has added many of them over a period of time, focusing first on consumer-oriented features that actually drive sales en masse. I'll close with a story about Steve Jobs' view of the enterprise as told by VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger: \"I went with (former Intel CEO Paul) Otellini to meet with Jobs and his lieutenants. We go into this meeting and say Steve, let's work together to make your Macs better for enterprise customers. Jobs looks at us and says 'Why would I do anything for that orifice called the CIO?'\" said Gelsinger. \"At Intel we're aghast; two-thirds of our business is that orifice called the CIO. He went on to say 'I'm going to build devices that are irresistible for consumers, and CIOs will just have to deal with it.\" Source : http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/10/5888203/a-chat-with-micros…", "score"=>161.16815, "summaryTitle"=>"Microsoft still doesn't get why the iPhone succeeded", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"About two weeks, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella penned a detailed memo to Microsoft employees, a mission statement of sorts, outlining the company&#039;s vision", "cities"=>["us", "de", "gb", "ca"], "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.tuaw.com/2014/07/24/microsoft-still-doesnt-get-why-the-iphone-succeeded/", "referrer"=>["twitterrific.com", "iconfactory.com", "t.co", "zite.to", "twittergadget.com", "gazette.com", "sharedby.co", "direct", "netvibes.com", "linkis.com", "linkedin.com", "lnkd.in", "bit.ly", "facebook.com", "getpocket.com", "corban.edu", "google.com", "flipboard.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/UqNKK4", "lastseen"=>"20140726004550", "page"=>"http://www.tuaw.com/2014/07/24/microsoft-still-doesnt-get-why-the-iphone-succeeded/", "ogtitle"=>"Microsoft still doesn&#039;t get why the iPhone succeeded"}, {"domain"=>"thepresidency.gov.za", "initial_epoch"=>"1406316628000", "h3"=>["About President Jacob Zuma", "The Presidency Profiles"], "site"=>"www.thepresidency.gov.za", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004804", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335684254", "title"=>"The Presidency | President writes to King of Abathembu on allegations", "initial"=>"20140725193028", "summaryText"=>"25 July 2014 President Jacob Zuma has written to His Majesty King Dalindyebo of the AbaThembu, asking him to make representations as to why the certificate of recognition as the King of the AbaThembu people should not be withdrawn from him, in line with", "content"=>"25 July 2014 President Jacob Zuma has written to His Majesty King Dalindyebo of the AbaThembu, asking him to make representations as to why the certificate of recognition as the King of the AbaThembu people should not be withdrawn from him, in line with the request from the AbaThembu Royal Family.

One of the children was pronounced dead at the scene and another at a hospital, Homicide Capt. James Clark said. (AP Photo/Philadelphia Daily News, Alejandro A. Alvarez) MANDATORY CREDIT; THE EVENING BULLETIN OUT, TV OUT; MAGS OUT; NO SALES PHILADELPHIA — Two men carjacked a woman at gunpoint but soon sped out of control, killing three children Friday as they plowed into a group selling fruit to raise money for their church, Philadelphia police said. Two women, including the mother of the three siblings killed, were critically injured. \"Three innocent children had their lives taken,\" Philadelphia Homicide Capt. John Clark said of the victims, ages 7, 10 and 15. The victims were struck late Friday morning about a mile from where the carjacking occurred. Police were looking for the suspects, who fled on foot. \"There are no words to describe how I feel right now,\" said police commissioner Charles Ramsey, \"but we do need to find these two guys.\" Police said they may have blown a tire as they turned a corner at high speed. The car ended up in a wooded area, its front end smashed against a stand of trees. \"Something obviously went horribly wrong,\" Clark said. The victims included a 15-year-old girl and her younger brothers. Their mother, 34, was in extremely critical condition, police said. Their identities were not immediately released. A neighbor helping the family sell fruit was also struck. The 65-year-old woman was in stable condition, police said. The carjack victim, a 45-year-old real estate agent who was forced into the backseat of her Toyota 4Runner, was also critically injured. Witness Renee Charleston saw a car streaking through the intersection, then noticed children on the ground. \"Nobody was moving,\" she told television station WPVI. Employees at Education Works, an educational nonprofit across the street from the wreck, told The Philadelphia Inquirer they ran to try to help the victims. One boy had no pulse and another's was barely there, said Karen Payne, who runs a summer camp there. \"I'm certified in first aid and CPR — my first instinct was to go to them,\" she said. \"But I couldn't help.\" Police were offering a $60,000 reward for the suspects' capture. They also asked nearby businesses for surveillance video and pleaded with anyone with information to come forward. Deputy Mayor Everett Gillison described the mayor as heartbroken. \"The prayers of the city go out to this family,\" he said.", "score"=>161.157, "summaryTitle"=>"Carjacked SUV hits crowd, killing 3 young siblings", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"PHILADELPHIA — Two men carjacked a woman at gunpoint but soon sped out of...", "cities"=>"us-co-colorado springs", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://gazette.com/carjacked-suv-hits-crowd-killing-3-young-siblings/article/1534358", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1l1U0PG", "lastseen"=>"20140726004715", "page"=>"http://gazette.com/carjacked-suv-hits-crowd-killing-3-young-siblings/article/1534358", "ogtitle"=>"Carjacked SUV hits crowd, killing 3 young siblings"}, {"domain"=>"viralnova.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406332224000", "h2"=>"These Creepy Animals Are Living Nightmares.

Assuring the world and the neighbors that the Taliban struggle is aimed only at forming an “independent Islamic regime and obtaining independence of our country”, the Taliban supremo said. “We are not intending to interfere in the (internal) affairs of the region and the countries of the world, nor do we want to harm them. Similarly, we don’t tolerate their role to harm us and urge them to have reciprocal stance.” The Taliban leader asked his fighters to protect Afghanistan’s borders. “I call on all Mujahideen in the frontier areas to protect their borders and maintain good relations with neighboring countries on the basis of mutual respect.” Fighting to continue till foreign troops leave Mullah Omar, whose whereabouts are unknown since the US military has dislodged the Taliban government in late 2001, said Taliban are winning their war against foreign forces and they will continue fighting until a single foreign soldier stays in Afghanistan. “We believe the war in Afghanistan will come to an end when all foreign invaders pull out of Afghanistan and a holy Islamic and independent regime prevails here,” he said in the message posted on the Taliban website. In a thinly veiled reference to a proposed security agreement that will see US troops remain in Afghanistan beyond the 2015 deadline, the Taliban chief said presence of limited number of troops, under whatever title, will mean continuation of occupation and the war. “This is because none can tolerate invading forces in one’s soil.” He also sent a veiled warning to the incoming Afghan leaders over the signing of the controversial security agreement with the United States that allows a longer stay of few thousands American troops beyond this year. “We would like to tell those who are contemplating to sign a security treaty with the invaders to desist from acts which add to prolongation of the invasion and to causes of the war. The presence of the invaders in our country is not in the interest of anyone. The continuation of war aggravates security of the region and the country,” warned Mullah Omar. Claiming that the Taliban are winning the war in Afghanistan, he said that the “blanket of invasion has rolled back from vast areas.” “Vital centers of the enemy have come under successful attacks in cities. Writ and administration of the Islamic Emirate has become stronger comparatively,” he further claimed. Highlighting the political role of his group, he said the Taliban have gained a political facade at world’s and internal levels through their office in Qatar. “Many entities that used to oppose us now have come around to accept the Islamic Emirate as a reality.” He referred to the recent exchange of the detainees with the US as a result of the efforts of the representatives of the Political Office of the Taliban was a spectacular achievement. The Taliban freed a US soldier for five senior leader released from the infamous American detention center at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Rejecting what he called the fake election process, Mullah Omar said that recent elections has plunged the Kabul Administration and Western democracy into disrepute. “In fact, the invaders and their internal allies wanted through the said process, to show to the Afghans that a (tangible) change has taken place. But the Afghans had realised their ambitions from the beginning. That is why majority of the people boycotted the process.” The Taliban leader claimed all now believe that election and the ballots of the people were mere slogans to deceive the people; sow racial, geographical and lingual and other hatred among the people. “We all now see that the American game under the name of elections proved, as in the past, to be selections. The power is in the hands of the invaders. What they say is compulsory on their internal allies to obey without taking into account interests of their country and people.” He urged the American and European governments, who have troops in Afghanistan or are intending to maintain political influence or military bases in Afghanistan, to let the Afghans establish an independent Islamic government on the basis of their religious and national aspirations. “If you want to deprive them of their right to form a government, it will be not only a tyranny and violation of human norms but also will result in the self-same consequences that you have seen in the past thirteen years,” he said.", "score"=>161.0506, "summaryTitle"=>"Eid message: Mullah Omar urges fighters to protect Afghan borders, not interfere in other countries", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Will contin&shy;ue fighti&shy;ng until a single foreig&shy;n soldie&shy;r stays in Afghan&shy;istan, says Omar.", "cities"=>"pk", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://tribune.com.pk/story/741083/eid-message-mullah-omar-urges-fighters-to-protect-afghan-borders-not-interfere-in-other-countries/", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1lEn2EX", "lastseen"=>"20140726004311", "page"=>"http://tribune.com.pk/story/741083/eid-message-mullah-omar-urges-fighters-to-protect-afghan-borders-not-interfere-in-other-countries/"}, {"domain"=>"wbaltv.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406334926000", "h3"=>["Comments", "Police: Car crashes into Cockeysville BBQ restaurant 18min", "City Ranch helps build inner city kids' confidence 16min"], "site"=>"www.wbaltv.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004539", "keywords"=>"co-worker, money", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335539656", "title"=>"10 things never to say to your co-workers | Project Economy - WBAL Home", "initial"=>"20140726003526", "summaryText"=>"Chance are you may spend more time with your co-workers than your loved ones.  That does not mean you should share everything with them.  Here are 10 things you should never tell your co-workers.", "content"=>"Chance are you may spend more time with your co-workers than your loved ones.  That does not mean you should share everything with them.  Here are 10 things you should never tell your co-workers.", "score"=>161.04774, "summaryTitle"=>"10 things never to say to your co-workers", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Chance are you may spend more time with your co-workers than your loved ones.&nbsp; That does not mean you should share everything with them.&nbsp; Here are 10 things you should never tell your co-workers.", "cities"=>"us-md", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.wbaltv.com/money/10-things-never-to-say-to-your-coworkers/22368254", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1l1neOs", "lastseen"=>"20140726004536", "page"=>"http://www.wbaltv.com/money/10-things-never-to-say-to-your-coworkers/22368254", "ogtitle"=>"10 things never to say to your co-workers"}, {"domain"=>"kopworld.net", "initial_epoch"=>"1406329301000", "h3"=>"LFC SUB", "site"=>"kopworld.net", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004710", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335630255", "title"=>"Transfer Scatter Gun Approach - | Kopworld LFC fans forum", "initial"=>"20140725230141", "summaryText"=>"This website uses cookies to help provide a better browsing experience.

Moving slowly (literally), but making good progress. (Read My Uterine Fibroids Journey, Part 1 .) I’m looking forward to sharing more in an upcoming post about my recovery. My family members have taken good care of me, including making meals that fit my food-sensitive diet. One of things I’ve enjoyed most is this gluten-free, dairy-free, refined sugar-free custard created by my mother. It’s been soothing, especially at 4:00 am, when I’ve had to wake up to take my pain medication with food. Here it is, with only four ingredients, used with her permission. You won’t believe it doesn’t contain dairy, it’s so creamy. The key is utilizing the water-bath method, so don’t forget that important step. Ingredients 4 eggs 2 cups of coconut milk (1 can) 2 tablespoons of honey 1 teaspoon of vanilla Directions Mix all ingredients in a blender on low. Pour into single serve oven-safe dishes or ramekins. (I used five for latest recipe.) Place raw custard dishes into larger oven-safe containers in a water bath. (See photo.) This protects the custard from getting overdone. Bake in oven on 350 degrees for approximately 45 minutes. Makes 4-6 servings. Serve hot or cold with fruit, if desired. Notes You can bake the custard in larger cookware like an 8 X 8 Pyrex pan, but you will need to increase the cooking time. Plus, the single-serve dishes are convenient for serving. We like to use Glasslock food containers for baking and storing in the refrigerator. (Do not place plastic lids in the oven!) Unlike the photos here, you can also use a large pan for the water bath and place all the bowls inside for baking. I like custard best when it’s chilled. It seems more refreshing cold, but you can also serve it hot out of the oven. Try this recipe with your favorite fruit or spices! Here are a couple variations I’ve tried successfully. (It’s really difficult to mess up! It’s been delicious every time I’ve made it.) Experiment with whatever ingredients sound good to you and cook in the same manner. With banana or your favorite fruit… 4 eggs 2 cups of coconut milk (1 can) 1 small banana or your favorite fruit 1 tablespoon of honey (less honey with the added fruit sugar) 1 teaspoon of vanilla With your favorite spice… 4 eggs 2 cups of coconut milk (1 can) 2 tablespoons of honey 1 teaspoon of vanilla 1 teaspoon of nutmeg or cinnamon I hope you enjoy this super easy custard recipe as much as I have, even at four in the morning! Double the recipe and serve at a dessert party, or offer to a friend who is recovering from surgery, like me. Great for singles, families, or large gatherings, this dairy-free, gluten-free custard will have you savoring each bite, down to the last spoonful.", "score"=>161.02231, "summaryTitle"=>"I Can’t Believe It’s Not Dairy!

This Examiner article covered the first incident. The owner of China Garden Buffet, located at 5648 Calhoun Memorial Highway in Easley, South Carolina, thought he'd be breaking health rules by allowing Joanne Powner and her 6-year-old service dog Nikki into his establishment. When the first incident occurred on June 20, the police were called, and the owner told Joanne that she and Nikki would be provided service in the future. On July 18, Joanne and a group of friends paid a visit to China Garden Buffet for dinner. During their dinner, Joanne was told she and Nikki had to leave, as dogs weren't permitted in the restaurant. Joanne and her friends once again visited the China Garden Buffet, this time for dinner around 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday, July 23. Once again, she was disrespected by the restaurant owner. Officer Burke with the Easley Police Department was called to the restaurant, resulting in yet another police report. Joanne has issued the following statement \"I Joanne Powner would like to file a complaint of a law being broken with my service dog. This is the second time ( see Easley incident report case # 2014-03531) I have been humiliated and discriminated against by a restaurant. The restaurant is China Garden located on 5648 Calhoun Memorial Highway. At approximately at 20:35 hour on July 18, 2014 I (Joanne Powner) entered China Garden with 8 other people. The owner Mr. Weng sat us all the way in the back a partially separated room from the establishment . There was a table in the main area of the restaurant he could of seated us at. After we sat down to eat he told me I would have to leave by the side door. The side door was marked emergency door only. He unlocked the door so I can leave thru that door.

Q: What are the laws that apply to my business? A: Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), privately owned businesses that serve the public, such as restaurants, hotels, retail stores, taxicabs, theaters, concert halls, and sports facilities, are prohibited from discriminating against individuals with disabilities. The ADA requires these businesses to allow people with disabilities to bring their service animals onto business premises in whatever areas customers are generally allowed. The ADA doesn't say \"maybe\" or \"perhaps\" a service animal should be allowed. The American with Disabilities Act REQUIRES a business to allow that person inside. Joanne had already shown the paperwork on Nikki the first time she encountered a problem. Joanne, I think it's a disgrace that any establishment would refuse you and Nikki service. American veterans should receive preferential treatment, especially those who returned to this country with a mental or physical disability. You have a heart of gold to even give China Garden Buffet a chance to regain your business. Personally, I'd have used some language that would likely have gotten me banned or arrested.

After several years in the semiwilderness she’s signed to RCA, knocked together a new album and is on the verge of re-entering the ‘pop milieu’. During the course of our telephone conversation she talked about why the time is right to get back in the pop saddle, her vision for the new album, how she might leak the songs that didn’t make the cut and why she chose the ones that did. S he also acknowledged that while the whole ‘staging a comeback’ thing might not be easy, she’s going to give it a good old go.  ( Oh, and she wouldn’t mind recording ‘Boom Clap’ after all, thanks very much.)   Here’s how it unfolded. ▽ Hello Hilary. You’re back! I’m back! (Laughs) Yes. Let’s begin.  Is this a comeback that’s principally based in nostalgia or in something brand new? I think it’s a combination of both. I definitely have a little place in people’s hearts from the past, but also I think they’re interested to see what I’ve come up with and who I am now. I want to believe that. I don’t think people are so fickle that they only want to see me because I’m Lizzy McGuire or something. Who, in 2014, do you think is a Hilary Duff fan? I think it’s a pretty broad range. It’s amazing with the internet now, how you can pinpoint who your target audience is. I think a lot of them are my age because they grew up with me and maybe a little bit older because of them wanting to see what I’m wearing all the time or young mums who have kids the same age as my kid. I think it’s also 14-to-18-year-olds still. What sort of hair do they have? What sort of hair? Yes. Erm, I think they’re fashionable girls who try to look fashionably dishevelled. Like me, I never want my hair to be perfect, I want it to be a little fucked up. I want to wear boots with tight jeans and a t-shirt that looks really old but is probably quite expensive. I’m a flea market digger. Sometimes I manage to pull it together and be like ‘I look cute today’ and then other times I’m a hot mess with a two-year-old. He’s in this whole thing where he doesn’t want me to put my hair in a ponytail. Does he like the new songs? Yes he loves them, it’s really cute. I’ve been away from him for two days, and his dad took him camping to have a little boys trip, and I was talking to him on the phone last night and he doesn’t like talking on the phone unless he thinks he’s talking to Elmo, but I started singing to him and he said ‘more, more’ and it really made my heart hurt a little bit. What was it about the single ‘Chasing The Sun’, among all the other piles of amazing songs you probably heard, that made it seem like the right first single? Honestly it was a really tough choice. I think it was a close tie between ‘All About You’, ‘Chasing The Sun’ and ‘Tattoo’ probably. It’s a really carefree, summer song and I guess I didn’t really know what people were expecting from me. This song is definitely a top-down [we imagine she means cars not garments], carefree, super catchy singalong song and so I guess we thought that would be a good move. Most singers these days find it important to stamp their name all over a song, but you haven’t written on this one. Have you still found a way to make it personal? I’m not a snob, like ‘I have to write everything’. There are so many amazing writers out there and one of the best things about this record for me was that I did get to write as much as I wanted and work with other people as much as I wanted. Some of the best work comes from when you’re collaborating with people and then sometimes a song comes along and you hear it and you’re like ‘okay, I think that’s a smash, don’t give it away!’.There has to be a balance. Some of the biggest pop acts out there love to write, but a lot of their singles aren’t things they’ve written. The big ‘Hilary’s back’ press release says that you arrived at your new label RCA “with a vision for the album”. What was that vision Hilary? When I first started recording, the album was a lot heavier. It was a lot more serious. I started to steer away from that because as part of my personality, I do like to have fun and I do like to live as carefree and big as possible and do things that make me happy and be a positive person. So the album took on those kinds of legs and I got inspired by some of the folkier-type music (!). I love Mumford & Sons and I love The Lumineers. It’s definitely a straightforward pop album but with a bit of that influence in there. When I came to the label I just kept saying ‘I want it to feel a little earthy and authentic’ because I’m from Texas, and they were like ‘earthy? What does that mean?’. But that’s the best way I can describe it. It’s definitely pop – I wanted to have those melodies that get stuck in your head – but also have some foot-stomping and claps that bring me back to my roots. Is there any EDM on there? No, it’s all gone! (Laughs) Even though that’s where I started. A few songs I came up with were really cool and you kind of get heartbroken when you realise no one’s ever going to hear them and they’re going to be trashed. LEAK THEM. (Laughs) You know what, that’s not a bad idea. After the album’s at the end of its cycle that would be cool to let the fans see a different side, but it wasn’t the push that I wanted to have out there. Another press release claim: “The album is a great representation of the experiences I’ve had in my life and where I want to go from here!” What experiences are you talking about and where are you going? Oh gosh. Let me think about some of the songs… But were there experiences you’d had that you definitely wanted to be represented on the album? I’d taken such a long break. It wasn’t like I was totally gone – I was doing a little bit of acting here and there, and if you’re living in LA it’s kind of hard to hide so my life was definitely still on display. It’s not like people haven’t seen me in seven years, I just wasn’t interested in doing music. I had a lot of time to grow and become the person I want to be and not be exhausted with work and on tour. I got to remodel a house, which was amazing, and I met my husband. I got married, I had a baby, I travelled all over the world. A lot of it was really hard. I shut down a business [Lizzy McGuire] that was making a tonne of money and everyone thought I was crazy at the time, you know. That was a tough challenge for me at a young age to decide to do that and be like ‘I need a break and I need to hang on to my sanity’. That was a really scary thing to do. I learned a lot about my strength and fighting for what I needed and there’s some of that on the record. Obviously I’ve had a little bit of heartbreak and troubles in my relationships, so there’s some of that on there too, plus, even though I’m a mum, I like to let loose and get a little wild sometimes. Do you think artists are right to view pop as a job for life, or do you think increasingly it has to just be one of various things you do, and perhaps only for a certain period? I guess everyone’s different but for me, I had toured for five or six years pretty much in a row and then when I wasn’t touring I was squeezing in filming a movie and I just got to a point… Well, I love my fans and I’ve loved all the travelling and being on stage, there is no bigger reward to have that feeling of people who don’t even speak the same language as you screaming the words of your songs back to you, it’s so ridiculously rewarding. But it is isolating and it was lonely and once I had turned twenty I was like, ‘I’m going to go crazy’. I needed to learn what I liked and who I was and make normal people decisions, not these epic and crazy [ones]. There was a lot of pressure. I was also struggling in my acting career and trying to get people to see me in a different way. There are lots of routes you can take to try and convince people you’re not the same as you were and I think my choice was to take a step back from everything and then just deal with the consequences of that fact that I might never get it all back again. But I’m going to try damn hard! You touched on it there but obviously there’s a lot of chatter about how the transition from Disney product to proper popstar makes it difficult to stay normal and not go a bit crazy… For a while there I was so busy I didn’t have time to get in trouble. I think I was just ready to experience a lot of things. I’m not saying I was perfect – I managed to find a little bit of trouble, you know, just normal things for my age. I was just a bit more private about it. I was ready to live my life and not be blasted on the cover of Star magazine, you know, all of that shit. This is your fifth studio album. You’ve made some great singles but not a classic album yet. Is this one it? Well to date this is definitely my favourite album but who’s to say  what’s a classic? Hopefully my fans will think that it is and I think that it is. The thing that has always drawn my fans to me is that I am authentic and I am reachable to them and I am honest. I’ve done everything I can to accomplish that on this record and it’s taken me a long time – I started in September and I’m here now. You’re also going to be doing some more acting in a TV show called Younger. How committed are you to pop? Won’t the TV stuff get in the way? I mean, [music] is definitely my focus right now. When I start shooting it’s from September to December, so my record should be finished by then and I think we’re talking about a fall [she means autumn] release, so I’ll be around to do press and then when the show wraps on December 12 I’ll be doing a full press push for the record and I just have to commit myself to that. Then you can put your feet up for Christmas! I’ve been in hibernation for seven years so I’ve got a lot of energy! I’m an all or nothing kind of girl – I need my plate to be either completely empty or completely full. You’ve shifted 15m records worldwide. Do you think you’ll sell another 15m? HELL YEAH! Of course. I think you have to believe it and be confident in anything you want. So of course I believe that. It might take a few years, but I think I’ll do it again. ‘So Yesterday’ is probably one of the greatest songs of all time isn’t it? Oh wow, that’s a big compliment, thank you. What do you remember about recording it? I remember not   wanting to record it or have it on my album and my manager was like ‘no, you’re recording this one’. Oh. Why didn’t you like it? I don’t know. You know what’s funny is that my mum is a major Cher fan – I’m actually a huge Cher fan too – and she [Cher, not Hilary's mum] just played the Staples centre in LA and I surprised my mum and got tickets to see her like tenth farewell tour. (Laughs) It was amazing and I just love her. Before she performed one of everyone’s favourite songs, ‘Just Like Jesse James’, she told this whole story about how she didn’t like the song and her manager made her do it and it was kind of the same thing with ‘So Yesterday’. The Matrix were really hot at the time and they had done a lot of work on one of Avril Lavigne’s records, and I was a big Avril fan so I was excited about working with them, but I was just not into ’So Yesterday’. I ended up just sucking it up and recording it and it turned out amazing. Did you see that Cher also didn’t like ‘If I Could Turn Back Time’ and Diane Warren had to physically restrain her in the studio to get her to record it? That’s so crazy to me. Some people are touched by certain things and some people aren’t, but that’s what I mean about recording music that I haven’t written on – there are so many talented people out there so if you get a chance to work on a song and make it your own then you should. And ‘Chasing The Sun’ is such a relatable song and it’s close to something I would have written for myself. Presumably what you’ve learned over the years is when to fight for a song and when to trust other people. Yeah of course. Even when I was working for Disney and I didn’t get to write and I was working with certain people if there were songs I didn’t like they wouldn’t make me do it, but they did have a heavier influence on what the records would sound like in compared to what my tastes were at the time. But now the tables have turned and the fans want to be so connected to the artist and if you’re singing something that isn’t authentic then they’re going to smell it on you. Finally: why did you turn down ‘Boom Clap’? I didn’t know that I had an option to have it. It’s my favourite song on the radio right now. I remember there was talk about my label trying to get us to write together and it was in New York and I was flying home so I didn’t have time to have a session with her. I am literally obsessed with that song and I didn’t know that it was an option for me. Do you think it would have worked as a Hilary Duff song? Yes I do. If she wants to give it to me now I’ll still take it! □ ‘Chasing The Sun’ is out in the autumn. You can keep up with Hilary over on Facebook .

That’s the day I began working at Pacers Sports & Entertainment. At that time, my youngest sister of three – but still older than me – was a ball kid for the WNBA’s Indiana Fever. She was also a great athlete and had her own sporting events every day. She was active with not only her high school sports, but also AAU basketball and travel soccer. Simply put, she was busy for a Fever game and needed a sub, only she couldn’t find one. Ultimately, she called her boss, Elizabeth Dewhirst, and said something like, ‘My brother knows basketball and is around it all the time. He could fill in.’ Liz said yes. I was assigned the rookie/beginner tasks, like mopping, folding towels, and rebounding – but I loved it. Liz felt I did a good job and asked me to do more games. Then, at the end of the season, asked if I wanted to continue on. Um, duh. Of course I would! A couple years into it, I figured why not also be a ball boy for the Pacers? So I had a brief interview with team trainer Josh Corbeil and was hired on. I worked eight years with the Pacers, up until graduation from Indiana University in 2012, and 10 with the Fever. I lucked out and had a daily role with the Fever during their 2012 WNBA Championship season. The latter half of those years with the Pacers were spectacular, as one of the lead ‘locker room attendants,’ – that’s now what we called ourselves – in charge of the visitor’s locker room. Basically we took care of anything they needed. It was our jobs to make them to feel comfortable and not sweat the little things. I could go on and on about that role, maybe write a book, but it was incredibly special and fun. A few months after graduating, I discovered that there was an opening at Pacers.com. What a great opportunity to continue on with the team I grew up watching and had been around for nearly a decade. I remember finding out around midnight one night, and then I immediately worked to make my interest known. An email was fired, with my resume attached, around 2 a.m. (Go after what you want!) In August of 2012, I was hired on as the team’s reporter. The team – coaches, players, and staff – were sensational to deal with and helped make the sacrifices the job requires worth it. I was with them more often than family and friends. As others have said, it’s the people that make the job. That’s 100 percent true. After two years now, my time with the franchise is complete. Over the years, I thoroughly enjoyed my various roles. I am so thankful for the things I got to do and people I met. (To answer your questions: Best player to deal with as a locker room attendant: Shaq. Worst: Kevin Garnett.) But my true passion is broadcasting. More specifically, calling games for a team. There’s nothing like that feeling. At the moment, I’m not exactly sure what’s next, but I hope to be back behind the microphone soon. I plan to continue Pacers coverage, plus other Indiana teams, right here on my baby of four-plus years. Thanks to those that follow me on Twitter, and please continue to do so. I always enjoy the friendly conversations. It was an honor to work for the team, and an honor to serve the fans as the team’s reporter for the past two seasons. As always feel free to tweet me, or contact me with something longer at the ‘Contact Us’ button at top. From owner Herb Simon on down, I thank PS&E for being an special part of nearly half my life. - Scott Agness", "score"=>160.97969, "summaryTitle"=>"Following my passion, it’s on to a new chapter", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>"us-in", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.vigilantsports.com/2014/07/25/following-my-passion-its-on-to-a-new-chapter/", "referrer"=>["hoopshype.com", "direct", "t.co", "twitterrific.com", "facebook.com", "sportsmanias.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1tLcedA", "lastseen"=>"20140726004041", "page"=>"http://www.vigilantsports.com/2014/07/25/following-my-passion-its-on-to-a-new-chapter/", "ogtitle"=>"Following my passion, it&#039;s on to a new chapter"}, {"domain"=>"iheart.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406323880000", "h3"=>["Kidd Kraddick In the Morning", "Photos", "Celeb gossip", "Like us on Facebook", "Contests", "Concerts"], "site"=>"news.iheart.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004804", "keywords"=>"watch, morgan, freeman, sucks, helium, National - Trending (Pop), top, 40, top 40, top40, hit, hits, music, 106.1, 1061, 106.1fm, fm, kiss, kiss-fm, khks, khks-fm, dallas, fort worth, ft. worth, ft worth, ftw, dfw, metroplex, khks-fm, khks, fm, dallas-tx, dallas, tx, radio, listen, live, iheart, iheartradio, chr, pop, dallas, fort, worths, hit, music", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335684251", "title"=>"WATCH: Morgan Freeman Sucks On Helium During Hilarious Jimmy Fallon Interview | 106.1 KISS FM", "initial"=>"20140725213120", "summaryText"=>"Permalink     Posted Friday, July 25th 2014 @ 1pm Listen to History of Rap Radio on iHeartRadio Morgan Freeman has one of those distinctive, unforgettable voices that you just can't mistake for anyone else.

The birthrate in 2013 was a record-low 62.9 births per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44, according to preliminary data from the National Center for Health Statistics . But just as the recession hit some states harder than others, birthrates generally declined more in states most affected by the slump. That’s illustrated by this chart, from The Washington Post’s new Storyline project. States such as Nevada, Arizona and Florida that saw some of the biggest plunges in home values after the housing bubble burst had some of the biggest birthrate declines between 2008 and 2010. Conversely, birthrates fell only slightly in North Dakota and Alaska, states that avoided the worst of the recession due to the boom in oil and gas production. The Post’s Jeff Guo noted that similar birthrate dips occurred after recessions in the 1970s and 1990s, and births likely will rebound as the economy regains its health. But as Fact Tank reported last month , the post-recession decline in births already has slowed the nation’s projected shift to a majority-minority youth population.

Buy low, sell high - a merchant's motto is easy to", "content"=>"About the Game Regain your riches, restore your honor and punish those who have wronged you. Merchants of Kaidan is a challenging trading game fused with lots of RPG elements. You start very humble, one cart, a purse of gold and silver coins is all that you have. Your task is to roam the world and search of opportunities to score some profit. Buy low, sell high - a merchant's motto is easy to grasp. And yet the job is harder than it seems. A good merchant needs to know everything about the market, he is always on the lookout for a deal, always listening, always engaging and deepening his knowledge. He knows what forces influence the prices, what events affect them. A good merchant listens to rumours and gossips spread by travelers at inns and taverns; hoping for a clue, a hint where to go, where a good deal awaits. A good merchant surrounds himself with specialists smarter than him, people who help him maximize profits and minimize losses. He always expands his fleet of carts, he balances risks, calculates profitability. The conditions are constantly changing, and supply and demand for different goods with them. Maybe you'd like to pay a cheaper price for furs in the summer, and sell them for a hefty profit as the winter is coming and people need warmth. But is it worth carrying them for so many days, risking robbery, moths and taking precious space that you could use to transport something now and make a profit immediately? Or is it worth to buy illegal herb in the out of reach swamps where it cost's next to nothing, and risk smuggling it into the city where you can sell it for an amazing profit? But what if the city guards want to control you? Should you pay a bribe? How big? Maybe the best course of action is to say that you have nothing and hope they don't find anything? These are the types of questions you will have to ask yourself constantly. Merchants of Kaidan has 4 story lines each with many quests. Main quest that brings you closer to avenging your father's murder, and 3 side-quest lines. A total of over 100 quests each composed of multiple steps. A set of random events that influence your journeys. A storm on the sea, attack by dragons, highway robbery and many, many more. Three types of transport of your goods: by roads, by sea and by flight, each has its advantages and disadvantages and a unique set of events associated. As you grow your fleet you can join a partnership and you'll get to manage 3 traders. You can hire advisers each specializing in a different field. Their council will help you in a variety of issues. Some will show you shortcuts on the roads, some will help you fight of the bandits, some will council you on how to sail better and in case of a storm, how to minimize risks and losses. If you wish, you can also send them to school to improve their abilities for additional cost. 4 seasons of the year that influence the prices of goods, open some paths for travel and block the others. They also impact the way the game looks, each city has a distinct look at different time of the year. Random blessings and curses that influence your statistics. They in turn affect how well you conduct business. A set of artifacts that influence your statistics or can help negate the effects of random events. A complex market fluctuation algorithm that include many variables such as: demand, supply, seasons of the year, localization of the city, random events like droughts or rat infestation. A complex trading algorithm Over 100 quests each with multiple steps to success. 2 out of 10 planned mini games that accompany events with next ones upcoming in the updates Possibility to create a partnership with other traders and control 3 characters simultaneously 1 main and 2 quick scenarios 15 types of goods for trade with varying characteristics, some illegal, some perishable Beautiful hand-drawn localisations. We intend to expand the game by many elements. These are the things that we intend do do. We are of course open to every idea and player's feedback. With your help we intend to create the best trading game. Adding several more 3D mini-games associated with in-game events: - Mine penetration, finished by a fight with monsters - Ruins penetration, where you prevent the monster from escaping - Game of craps with other traders - Defending the caravan from the robbers - Defending the caravan from dragon's attack - Evading the robbers (a tactical minigame based on hexes) - Navigating the sea in the fog - Fighting the pirates Increasing the number of random events by about 3 times. Increasing the number of quests to about 140. Establishing your own sources of passive income like villages, quarries, pleasure houses. Creating a partnership with other \"NPC\" traders that the player would command, each would have it's strengths and disadvantages. Improving the graphical aspects of the game. Increasing the size of the map with new regions Ideas proposed by players. Your name is Olivean de Calinn, and this was supposed to be the most important day of your life. Your father has been preparing you, for all these years, for this exact moment. Your 21st birthday. You were finally a grown-up, able to take care of yourself, a person worthy of continuing your fathers' legacy. He wasn't born into money. To buy his first cart, he had to work very hard saving every silver and copper. One trade after trade, step after step, he climbed the ladder, transforming his tiny one-man venture into a trading company of a rather significant size. Then he met Van Talodd, the most famous merchant in the whole kingdom, and soon enough he entered into partnership. This enterprise proved very profitable, and Van Talodd promised your father something more precious than wealth. A lordship. Few weeks ago he left to the Capital – Ovoros – to accept the title. He was taking a little longer to come back than you expected, but recent weather was unfavourable, maybe he got stuck, or a road turned into a swamp... it happened all the time. It was almost dusk when you heard the knocking to the door. A messenger, his clothes soiled with mud, brought you a letter. There was no lordship, your father was found a traitor, an enemy of the Kingdom, and hanged for conspiring against the king, after a very hasty trial. All his assets and estate confiscated and handed over to the person who exposed the entire plot – Van Talodd. Suddenly everything became crystal clear, Van Talodd maimed him with promises of lordship, the only thing money can't buy. But his real purpose was to entrap your father and take over his fortune. Instead of your birthday present, you got carts full of kings' sell-swords approaching quickly. There was no time to loose, you had to run fast and far. Flee from the men that were certainly sent to kill you. That is only a beginning of your story, you're left with only your family ring that you had on you. Take a fake name you need to avenge your father. Follow the same path as him, grow rich and destroy Van Talodd. The road there is hard and long – are you strong enough to make it? Kaidan is a fictitious world, that was once a home to a space-faring civilization. It's history is almost unknown. Only that, once they developed starships, they relatively quickly left the planet. And on the remnants of the old civilization a new one has sprouted. A far less developed.

Some teams think he is a fourth outfielder but others believe he can be more.” Castillo, 27, has already been declared a free agent by MLB and is free to sign. He is represented by Jay-Z’s Roc Nation. “Castillo has good strength for his relatively short stature and is an athletic player whose best tool is his plus-plus speed … Castillo can sting the ball from the right side of the plate, projecting as a line-drive bat who hits a lot of doubles and triples rather than home runs. He’s an aggressive hitter with good bat speed, though his swing can get long at times and he will expand his strike zone,” wrote Ben Badler recently. Here’s the obligatory highlight video . Because of his age, Castillo would not count against a team’s international signing pool, not that it matters for the Yankees at this point. They haven’t signed a big name Cuban player since getting burned by Jose Contreras, though they did show serious interest in Aledmys Diaz earlier this year and appear to be ready to get back into the market. I have no idea what kind of contract Castillo will command or if he makes sense for the Yankees, who already have two low-power outfielders signed for big bucks long-terms.

However, any notion that a week and 900 or so kilometres would make a difference was swiftly dispelled when we arrived in scorching Budapest.   If anything, the Hungaroring is even more of a cauldron, which is apt as this challenging little track is set inside a natural amphitheatre, with the track snaking its way around the bowl in the valley. OK, the temperatures on track today were a couple of degrees shy of the scorching 58 degrees Celsius we saw in Hockenheim, but only a couple – and when you looked out across the track in Germany, you aren't staring at the fresh, cooling, temptation of one of Europe's biggest aquaparks. The theme park is clearly visible from the back of the Energy Station here in Hungary and with the sun beating down at the Hungaroring, you see more than a few people looking out across the track to the flumes and slides. Why are people hanging around at the back on the motorhomes in the first place? Because it's gives a brilliant, brilliant view of the circuit. Seriously, one of the best views in Formula One: Turns Two and Three at the pit exit end of the paddock and Turn 13 at the entry – you just have to ignore the whiff coming off the bins.   It's one of the many perks of being at the Hungaroring. Another is staying in the heart of Budapest. Perhaps it's a consequence of always being here in high summer but it seems like one of the most lively and vibrant cities we visit, with everyone out on the streets and boulevards in the evenings. Fortunately for us quite a few of the Energy Station crew are natives of Budapest, and so we have excellent guides to some of the best places in town that might be a little way off the traditional tourist track. Not that any of this really sways us from the task at hand. This track hasn't been one of our best in the past and we've only ever won here once, in 2010, when Mark drove his socks off to take a great, great victory. It did involve him getting the instruction to drive 20 qualifying-pace laps off the reel – which is the sort of thing Mark lives to hear, so he had a smile as wide as the Danube as he came into parc ferme. Definitely one of our best-ever race memories. We've had a few podium to finishes to complement that but perhaps not as many as we should. That's something we're keen to correct this weekend.  ", "score"=>160.7983, "summaryTitle"=>"In The Hot Spot", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"There was a point last weekend when it was so hot in our Hockenheim garage we thought the concrete floor might melt.

A pair of large craters have formed in Siberia just days apart, and scientists are trying to figure out why it's happening. According to the Moscow Times, the two holes were found about 18 miles apart . The first one was more than 160 feet wide and about 230 feet deep. The report adds that the second, most recent, hole was much smaller. \"I've never seen anything like this, even though I have been to Yamal many times,\" Andrey Plekhanov told the Siberian Times . (MORE: Shocking Discovery During NASA Study ) Although the Yamal Peninsula is Russia's biggest production area for the country's gas supply to Europe, experts don't believe the holes were created by oil-production practices, the report also states. So what's causing gigantic these holes to form? An Explosive Danger About 10,000 years ago, the area was a sea, and a mixture of salt, sand, gas and water froze into ice underground, Sub-Arctic Scientific Research Center scientist Anna Kurchatova told the Siberian Times. As the globe has warmed, she said, the ice is melting and the gas is being released, causing an effect like a champagne cork popping off a bottle. These underground explosions are causing the holes, Kurchatova believes. (PHOTOS: See One of the World's Largest Man-Made Holes ) The holes may foreshadow bigger problems for our planet in the near future, scientists worry. Permafrost around the Arctic contains methane and carbon dioxide, and both  could be dangerous to our environment if released , according to a report from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. As long as the permafrost remains frozen, the report adds, this isn't a concern, but climate models have painted a grim future for rising temperatures in the Arctic. Gradually, a Salon report states, these holes could become more frequent around the Arctic as methane is released due to melting permafrost. However, the report also says it's difficult to predict when or where these explosions will occur because the remote nature of the tundra doesn't allow for much studying on how the methane is released.

Radcliffe seems incredible in this film that has a truly twisted sense of humor and an interesting mystery at the center as Radcliffe plays a man trying to figure out who killed his girlfriend ( Juno Temple ) as he causes chaos in a North Pacific town. Watch it ! Here's the first US trailer for Alexandre Aja's Horns , originally from MTV : Alexandre Aja ( Piranha 3D ) directs Horns with a script from Keith Bunin (\"In Treatment\") based on Joe Hill's novel of the same name. The story follows a 26-year-old man (Daniel Radcliffe) who wakes up after a nasty hangover to find his girlfriend (Juno Temple) has been raped and murdered and he's the lead suspect. Then he discovers horns growing out of his head that grant him the power to make people confess their sins, which comes in handy as he searches for his girlfriend's killer and prepares for revenge.

No wait, let me guess: tired as F and itchy as H? Me too! The past five days have been a nightmare. At least I think so – a nightmare is that thing that happens when you're asleep, right? I WOULDN'T KNOW because I've spent the last five nights wide awake, sweaty, and slapping myself in a sad effort to limit my bites during this INSANE MOSQUITO SITUATION. Back on Monday, I thought maybe a couple mosquitoes got tiny Groupons for my body's butt cheek special, but it seems like everyone in SF has been going through the same hell all week. It's bad. And I know other cities, cities that \"cool off\" to 91 degrees at night and where people encounter real bugs like centipedes and giant wasps will mock us for complaining about a slightly humid 70 and some mosquitos, but San Francisco is just not prepared for this kind of week. Generally, we're equipped for a temperate, bug-free heaven. Getting into bed, you have two options: Fight: Cover your entire body in blankets, snorkeling air out of a small hole in an attempt to create a barrier.  Give Up: Lay uncovered enough to drift off, knowing that you're offering up everything but your torso as a family-style meal. Hearing that \"eeeeee\" come at your face for the 11th time will probably inspire an unfiltered rage to hunt them. Good luck! Your ability to kill a mosquito is directly dependent on their proximity to you: In the dark: 0.5 inches from your ear. Lights on: On a wall, exactly four inches out of reach. Out of bed, \"weapon\" in hand: Completely disappeared, leaving you just a strung-out, haggard nut job holding a shoe and staring furiously at every fuzz and crack on the ceiling. You'll find that mosquitoes collectively disappear about 20 minutes before your alarm goes off, regardless of what time that may be. You may now begin your day with a fun game of \"find the new bites,\" which, despite your sweaty efforts, are guaranteed to be in the three absolute worst areas: I know as San Franciscans we're always saying how nice a hot night would be, but we're idealistic idiots, and this is not what we meant.", "score"=>160.70177, "summaryTitle"=>"SF Not Prepared for Hot Mosquito Hell", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Hey San Francisco, how are you?

The carrier had just picked up the iPhone, and was in the process of rolling out its LTE network, so it needed a low-cost way to save bandwidth. Fast forward to today, and Verizon issued a press release announcing a similar policy for LTE customers. Starting in October, the company plans to start “optimizing its network,” which is a nice way of saying it’s going to start throttling high-volume users… Here’s an excerpt from the press release : While all major wireless carriers employ tools to manage the traffic on their networks, Verizon Wireless uses network intelligence to slow the speeds of only some of its heaviest users on unlimited data plans, and only when those users are connected to a cell site that is experiencing peak usage at that particular time. Once the heavy usage eases, or the user moves to a different cell site, the user’s speeds return to normal. Verizon Wireless’ practice of Network Optimization ensures that all customers have the best wireless data experience possible. Starting in October 2014, Verizon Wireless will extend its network optimization policy to the data users who: fall within the top 5 percent of data users on our network, have fulfilled their minimum contractual commitment, and are on unlimited plans using a 4G LTE device. They may experience slower data speeds when using certain high bandwidth applications, such as streaming high-definition video or during real-time, online gaming, and only when connecting to a cell site when it is experiencing heavy demand. (Note: Does not currently apply to government or business accounts that have signed a major account agreement.) Again, this will only affect the top 5% of LTE users—using 4.7GB or more per month—that are still on unlimited data plans, and only when their cell site is experiencing peak usage. Users who don’t want to be throttled can switch to a new usage-based plan. The move is honestly not too surprising, given that Verizon has the largest and longest-running LTE network in the US. That means it has more customers using 4G than any other carrier, and its towers are getting overloaded in major cities like New York. I’m currently on a grandfathered unlimited plan with AT&T on LTE, and I’m wondering how long it takes before they follow suit.", "score"=>160.65544, "summaryTitle"=>"Verizon to soon begin throttling select unlimited LTE customers", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Back in 2011, Verizon began throttling data output for the top 5% of its 3G customers on unlimited data plans.

On Thursday, July 24, an employee accidentally left a kennel gate open, allowing multiple dogs to have direct contact with each other, including Kitti, a 12 year old Boxer/Pit Bull/Terrier mix. Two of the loose dogs engaged in a fight with Kitti, resulting in her death. Kitti had been in the Santa Barbara County Animal Shelter since June 12, 2014 following an incident during which she attacked another dog and that dog died. Kitti was kept in a separate area of the kennel where she did not have regular contact with other animals. On July 1, a Dangerous Dog hearing was held and, after hearing all of the testimony, a hearing officer found Kitti to be a designated \"dangerous dog.\" Any dog declared to be a dangerous dog requires the animal be humanely destroyed; Kitti remained in our kennel awaiting a potential appeal of this finding by the dog's owner. The entire agency is extremely concerned about the incident and is taking immediate steps to review the procedures in place to ensure it cannot happen again. We take very seriously the need to protect the animals in our care and know that while this was a tragic mistake, it was an unacceptable death of an animal in our care. Once a complete set of facts is known about what precisely occurred, the appropriate personnel actions will be taken, if required. The employee involved recognizes the error and is extremely upset about what took place. We extend deep sorrow to Kitti's owners.   21 comments on this article.

She tactfully paused, then asked, “What are you afraid of?” I couldn’t answer right away. I hadn’t really thought about it; I had simply obeyed the limitations of the fear without question. “I’m afraid of being ignored,” I finally realized, “that if I let go, I’ll disappear.” I’m a Leo. Traditional astrology will tell you that being ignored is not a problem most Leos have to contend with, adept as we are at calling attention to ourselves. But that is not my story. I was born with the Sun in hard aspect to Neptune , the planet of obfuscation. Far from being a flamboyant Leo queen, I spent much of my childhood in a fog, afraid of everything and everybody, hiding under furniture when unexpected visitors dropped by. I had only the most tenuous Neptunian boundaries to safeguard my sense of self. It has taken conscious work for many years for me to gain confidence, and most of the time I walk around thinking I’ve done a pretty good job. The conversation with my friend, however, pointed out that that I haven’t come as far as I’d thought. You needn’t be a sun-sign Leo, or have a difficult aspect between the Sun and Neptune, to relate to feeling a lack of confidence. You need only be human, with a human’s basic need to feel good about yourself and to be paid attention to. We think of the Sun—and Leo, the sign it rules — as symbols of self-expression and confidence. But perhaps what they symbolize is the striving for these things. The symbol for the Sun – a tiny speck surrounded by a circle – has always reminded me of the bulls-eye of a target, with the astrological Sun describing both the point that we are aiming for, and how we need to develop as an individual in order to reach that target. We begin as a tiny, nearly invisible speck, surround ourselves with empty, insulating space, and then build a solid circle around it all, a boundary to safely contain our fearful smallness. There is goodness in us too, and it is not so fearful or small. But if we draw our boundaries too tightly, we become a closed system, and the goodness has a hard time getting out. For some of us, building a strong enough circle can be the work of a lifetime. Others seem to have strong boundaries right from the start. People with healthy egos are able to dance between self and not-self , occasionally navigating liminal space where boundaries don’t exist, then safely returning to the center of the circle. They know how to play, and how to re-create themselves; they can shape-shift effortlessly, either permanently or as a mini-vacation from reality, seeing it all as one enjoyable and unfolding journey. But Leo, being a fixed sign, tends to find this kind of flexibility elusive, even threatening. Leo prefers to be himself, thank you; if Leo were an actor he would be John Wayne, who was always pretty much John Wayne, no matter what role he was playing onscreen. And so during the annual Leo season we are normally concerned with fortifying the traits and creative impulses that make up the boundary between us and other, and define our identities. Walking the labyrinth But at this New Moon in Leo, with the Sun, Moon, and Jupiter all square Mars, newly in Scorpio, the impulse to break with the past and hurdle toward a new adventure is at least as strong as Leo’s desire to bloom where we’re planted. Breaking with the past can be very liberating , and sometimes the only way to initiate change is to act boldly and irrevocably. At this New Moon, we have a better than average chance to make changes that really mean something. We live in reckless, destructive times. But seen another way, the world is in the process of recreating itself, and we are weaving change and upheaval into the fabric of our new future as we go along. Sanity tells us to be afraid, but faith whispers that there are no false moves now ; however random, even capricious these changes appear to be, they are embedding themselves into our new foundation like stray river rocks and sea glass. Perhaps this Leo New Moon season calls for a new glyph for the Sun -  not a closed circle with a dot in the middle, but rather a labyrinth. A labyrinth has a single, unambiguous route we can follow to the center and back. We set forth in life on a walk through this labyrinth, and no matter which course we take, or how lost we sometimes feel, we’ll inevitably end up precisely where we’re meant to be. The New Moon is a dark time. It is midnight now in our gardens, and it is tempting to suspect that chaos lurks in every shadow and to obey the limitations of fear without question. But while the New Moon in Leo is invisible to us just now, just below the horizon in the night sky, it’s still there, and we feel it even if we can’t see it. It reminds us that we are works in progress, and we are creating, every day, the selves we want to be and the world we want to live in. Even if there is much in the world, and in us, that could be better, Leo reassures us that it will be – because we are free to be whatever we want to be, and because there is so much good in us. © 2010/2012/2014 April Elliott Kent", "score"=>160.59181, "summaryTitle"=>"New Moon in Leo: Walking the Circle", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"We think of the Sun and Leo as symbols of self-expression and confidence.

Sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, is the unexplained death of an infant under age one. As a parent, I know that there is nothing scarier than the idea that your baby might suddenly stop breathing while she's sleeping. To help protect your baby from SIDS, always put her to sleep on her back. When she's awake, spending time on her side and tummy is good for muscle development, and to prevent the back of the head from flattening. Keep soft items, such as pillows, blankets, and stuffed animals, out of her crib. Use a firm mattress and tightly fitted sheets. Skip all bumper pads, too. They can restrict your baby's breathing if her face presses against them. Make sure that your crib slats or spaced no more than 2 and 3/8 inches apart. Offer a pacifier at night. Research has shown that it can help prevent SIDS. Avoid cigarette smoke. Studies show that exposure to second-hand smoke can increase a baby's risk of SIDS, so can smoking during pregnancy. Lastly, don't sleep with your baby anywhere, even the couch. She could be suffocated by a pillow or a loose blanket, or you could roll over on her.

Each eyeshadow is 0.0176 oz. each (0.106 oz. total), blush is 0.14 oz. each (0.28 oz. total), and lipstick is 0.02 oz. each (0.04 oz. total). Based on price per ounce, the kit contains $31.68 worth of eyeshadow, $28 worth of blush, and $6.40 worth of lipstick, which adds up to $66.08. There is also a dual-ended brush, so I guess that’s valued at $34.92 in order to add up to the $101 value listed. There were a couple of complete misses in this palette, but most of it was just average, which isn’t impressive. There were only three shades (out of 10) that were B+ or better rated. It’s always disappointing when MAC puts out subpar palettes like this, because they can do an excellent eyeshadow, so I don’t know why they don’t improve the formula in these. I’d rather they offer less product if they could be more consistent with the quality. Lessons in Love (Blush) is a light-medium pink with warm undertones and a soft, golden shimmer-sheen. It had decent color payoff, though it was slightly dry and powdery. It wore well for seven and a half hours before fading. See comparison swatches / view dupes . All Races (Eyeshadow) is a pale, cool-toned, lavender-gray with a matte finish. It is lighter and very, very stiff/dry in the pan–very unlike the single version I’ve used (it is limited edition but has been released previously). It started to fade after seven hours of wear. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Elementary Pink (Eyeshadow) is a brightened, light pink with cool undertones and a matte finish. It had good color payoff, and the texture was soft and finely-milled, though a touch powdery. I noticed fading after eight hours of wear. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Lingering Dusk (Eyeshadow) is a muted, bronzy pink with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had a drier consistency, which made getting the pigment out of it more difficult, and it didn’t blend as easily on the skin. The color wore well for seven and a half hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Dress to Impress (Lipstick) is a light, cool-toned milky pink. It had semi-opaque color coverage, and it applied fairly evenly, though not perfectly. The lipstick wore well for three hours and was neither drying nor hydrating. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Style Cast (Blush) is a light-medium, muted orange with gold shimmer. It had decent color payoff that was fairly blendable. The color stayed on for seven and a half hours before fading. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Fashion Beat (Eyeshadow) is a light-medium, golden taupe with warm undertones and a pearly sheen. It had good pigmentation that applied smoothly and was easy to blend. The color didn’t fade until after eight hours of wear. See comparison swatches / view dupes . Stormy Sunset (Eyeshadow) is a muted, light-medium gray with a hint of purple and a frosted finish. It had decent color payoff, but it wasn’t fully pigmented as a result of the slightly dry texture. The color wore well for seven and a half hours. See comparison swatches / view dupes .

I can’t imagine that they were such big sellers among the fanbase that someone in marketing wanted to spin off actual ugly sweaters, but here they are. Made for terrible “ugly sweater nights” at the game around Christmas, or your “ugly sweater party” at work that is supposed to be “fun,” the NHL has decided to embarrass teams with these monstrosities (click for a larger view): They certainly are successful at being both “ugly” and “sweaters.” I don’t know if fans of the 22 not-featured teams are upset that their team hasn’t been given this treatment. As a Blues fan, I am not crushed that I won’t have the opportunity to purchase one of these to wear in December for a casual Friday. The divided-squares look is certainly preferable to the horizontal name design, but neither are worth $65.

Phaedra is also taking some time to digest new information that has come to light concerning Apollo’s dealings with Kenya Moore . It appears Apollo wants to clear his conscience before heading to the concrete castle and has admitted he lied about Kenya coming on to him in retaliation for her putting him on blast for texting her. How embarrassing that must be for Phaedra, who has publicly read Kenya like a bedtime story for pushing up on her husband. Remember this?     During a recent taping of “The Real Housewives of Atlanta,” Apollo allegedly apologized to Kenya for lying about what really happened with textgate and the two of them settled their differences. Phaedra’s actions have spoken much louder than her words after she blew off Apollo’s hearing and it appears she has distanced herself from the habitual criminal. In a recent interview, Apollo admitted he doubts his marriage will last through his prison stint. Get the full scoop on this madness by visiting StraightFromTheA.com .

The couple had been on the outs for a while and reports circulated last month that Keyshia Cole was very close to filing for divorce, but hadn’t done so yet. Last week, a divorce was filed in L.A. County Superior Court under the name Daniel Gibson citing irreconcilable differences. In the documents, Gibson listed himself as his attorney, which caused suspicion. TMZ called the number listed in the documents and a man claiming to be the ex-basketball player answered. Something still seemed wrong and they checked the listed address. Turns out the listed address was an El Pollo Loco restaurant location.   The actual Daniel Gibson said he has never even thought about filing for divorce in spite of their relationship being over because he is a Christian and believes marriage is until death do you part. He also plans to press charges against the phony. Keyshia Cole says she still plans on filing for divorce when she gets ready.

On a Friday, with changing weather conditions and an improving track, getting the cars in shape is like doing a Crossword Puzzle: it doesn’t matter if the “Across” answer seems correct, if it does not line up with the “Down” solution. That was definitely the case today and although the Ferrari crew can only really know what its own cars are doing, you only had to watch the TV screens to see that, throughout the length of the pit lane, teams were facing similar conundrums. Essentially the two conflicting factors here are that, as more and more laps are completed, not just by the Formula 1 cars but also by those in the support races, the very dirty and green track surface gradually cleans up and provides more grip. However, at the same time, during the day the temperature rises – the track exceeded 50 degrees this afternoon – which had a negative effect, mainly on the harder of the two Pirelli compounds on offer this weekend. The engineering “trick” is not to over react to the changing conditions, but to estimate where the track will be for qualifying tomorrow and Sunday’s race. That’s no easy task either as it’s meant to get cooler and possibly even wet on Sunday. For the record, Fernando Alonso completed 49 laps today and ended up fourth fastest, behind the inevitable pace-setting Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel third for Red Bull. Kimi Raikkonen was sixth, doing ten laps more than his team-mate, with the McLaren of Kevin Magnussen keeping the two Prancing Horse apart.", "score"=>160.40268, "summaryTitle"=>"Hungarian GP – An engineering puzzle", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>"null", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://formula1.ferrari.com/news/hungarian-gp-engineering-puzzle", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "as-web.jp", "t.co", "direct", "bleacherreport.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1rRygeg", "lastseen"=>"20140725235122", "page"=>"http://formula1.ferrari.com/news/hungarian-gp-engineering-puzzle", "ogtitle"=>"Hungarian GP – An engineering puzzle"}, {"domain"=>"gawker.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406315709000", "h3"=>"Adam Weinstein", "site"=>"gawker.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726003452", "keywords"=>"oops, military, israel, army, patriot missiles, bureaucracy, Gawker", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406334892865", "title"=>"U.S. Army Mistakenly Mails Israel Missile Agreement to a Gawker Reader", "initial"=>"20140725191509", "summaryText"=>"Last night, Gawker got a tip from a longtime reader: \" I get a lot of emails for a different person with the same name as me,\" the message said. \"Someone who works in some capacity in the government.

I don't know if this one I just received about Israel, missiles, etc is even a thing.\" Yes, it's a thing. Our reader appears to have received internal Army correspondence regarding the U.S. military's ongoing agreement with Israel to sell and maintain Patriot missile systems. We've embedded those messages below; click to enlarge. The messages seem to pertain to a collection of aging Patriot missiles that are slated for \" demil ,\" defusing and dismantling in favor of newer weapons—perhaps the Army's upgraded PAC-3 Patriot missiles. The emails start with a request from a worker in the Army Missiles and Space Program Executive Office ; that's the office that manages all the high-tech missile hardware needs for the U.S. military. He communicates with another civilian in charge of Patriot missiles at the Army Security Assistance Management Division—the department that oversees foreign military sales to U.S.-friendly governments —as well as a contractor at Wyle Laboratories, which provides rocket science to Uncle Sam. \"Israel had stated that they want to take a couple of these and use for MADF training,\" he asks his counterparts, referring to training on the Patriot program's missile assembly and disassembly facility procedures. \"We could drill holes in the warhead shell and consider them DEMIL'ed so they could use them for this purpose.\" Then he adds that \" the 29 to be destroyed\" can be pillaged for spare parts, including safety devices and guidance systems, if the Israelis \"still wish to do this.\" He gets an answer in the affirmative, presumably after the plan has been approved by \"Major Brener\" of the \"IAF\"—possibly the Israeli Air Force. At some point, he asks the contractor from Wyle for the email address of another player who needs to be looped into the Israel deal. That's when she apparently CC'd the wrong email address for that player, accidentally forwarding the thread to the Gawker reader. The Patriot system, which became famous as a \"Scud buster\" during the first Gulf War, is a defensive array that can intercept incoming enemy ballistic missiles and aircraft. It's no secret that the U.S. sells those systems to at least 11 friendly nations , including Israel, which has a clear interest in defending its territory against air attacks. Via the Israel Defense Forces, here are some pictures of IDF Patriot missile soldiers working with their U.S. Army counterparts: And here's footage of a U.S.-built missile battery in place, reportedly near Haifa, Israel: It's unclear whether this is a routine request or is related to a higher military operational tempo arising from Israel's operations in Gaza, but the former seems likelier. The rockets being launched at Israel by Palestinian militants are too small a target for Patriot missiles; instead, Israel relies on newer defense systems like the vaunted \"Iron Dome.\" But it keeps Patriots around for bigger airborne threats that might come from Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, or elsewhere. (The Patriots and Iron Dome systems are both built with help from the same U.S. defense contractor, Raytheon.) Even if it's a routine request, the email thread offers an interesting window into how much bureaucracy the U.S. military dedicates to serving its allies' weaponry needs. And also, how easy it is to email that data to some Gmail user who reads Gawker. For a bonus, here's one of the slides the U.S. Army shows its counterparts from friendly militaries when trying to sell them Patriot missiles. Very straightforward. Also, here's the email thread in text form.

However, the fact that they’re now occupying a space on the adjacent public beach has outraged some neighbours and beachgoers. “Myself and my family are extremely offended,” says Dennis Roszell, who owns a home across from the beach. “You don’t set up a nude beach in public. It shows absolute and total disrespect for all of civilization and all of society.” Last month, the Pinkowski family, which owns a seven-hectare parcel of land fronting Okanagan Lake’s Three Mile Beach , told nudists that they were trespassing and blocked access to their property with fencing, signs and security guards. “I’m sure they’re upset,” says Cary Pinkowski. “They had their private, secluded area but it was private property that they’ve been using all this time.” The family purchased the land in 2006 and has been trying to sell it for the last few years, but Pinkowski says nudists on the beach were scaring off prospective buyers, shouting that they had been using the land for years and would never leave. “It was pretty uncomfortable,” Pinkowski says. “Basically any prospective buyer doesn’t want to hear that and walks away.” Dustin Wolchina, a naturist who has been speaking for beach users, says he and other nude-beach regulars were surprised when they were denied access. “They’re really, really disheartened — it’s ridiculous,” he says. Wolchina acknowledges that it’s private property, but says they have always been respectful and kept the area clean, even improving it in some spots. He says no one from the Pinkowski family tried to contact the nudists before cordoning off the beach. Pinkowski says his family is not blocking foreshore rights — the area below the high-water point can still be accessed — but they will not allow people to continue to trespass. Under B.C. law, the land from the high-water mark to the low-water mark of any stream, river, lake or ocean cannot be privately held and remains under Crown ownership. Owners above the foreshore cannot own the water, only the right to access. Now the nudists are hanging out adjacent to the Pinkowski property, where Wolchina says they are being harassed by some neighbours and members of the public. “It’s not comfortable any more, it’s not relaxing,” says Wolchina. “We’ve been victimized and we’re done with it. We don’t want to play the game. We’ve done nothing that’s not respectable.” Roszell vehemently disagrees. He says he’s seen sex acts performed in the open and postings online soliciting sexual encounters at the beach. “They have no respect for families whatsoever,” he says. “They’re not a benign group of people being themselves. These are an extremely offensive, extremely disrespect group of people that have no holds barred. I’ve seen them walk up to kids wangin’ their dangs.” Penticton RCMP spokesman Sgt. Rick Dellebuur says he’s received complaints about the nude sunbathers and swimmers on the public beach, but they’ve come from a small group of people and have tapered off recently. He says there have been no issues with lewd acts or indecency. When complaints are received officers speak to both parties and try to resolve the disagreement by asking nudists to move or cover up. “What we’re doing now is trying to get people to coexist there,” Dellebuur says. Wolchina says the nudists have been exploring other areas to occupy, but what they’ve found so far is dangerous or can be accessed by boat only. He hopes the city will intervene when council is back in session and designate part of Three Mile Beach as clothing optional. Mayor Garry Litke could not be reached for comment. “We’re about peace, and relaxation, and being with the environment, and being part of the environment and community,” Wolchina says. “We have lost our reflection place.” jensaltman@theprovince.com twitter.com/jensaltman Some clothing-optional beaches in B.C. — Wreck Beach, Vancouver — Iona Beach Park, Richmond — Crescent Rock Beach (Crescent Beach), Surrey — “Barnston Bare Beach,” Barnston Island — Prior Lake (Thetis Lake Regional Park), View Royal — Brunswick Beach, Lions Bay — White Rock (Kalamalka Lake), Vernon — Little Tribune Bay, Hornby Island — Cedar Creek Park, Kelowna — Red Sands Beach, Nelson — “Nipple Point,” Salmon Arm", "score"=>160.30627, "summaryTitle"=>"Penticton nude beach row roils waters of Okanagan Lake", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Penticton&amp;#8217;s nude swimmers and sunbathers are trying to carve out a new space for themselves after", "cities"=>"ca-bc", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.theprovince.com/news/Penticton+nude+beach+roils+waters+Okanagan+Lake/10060211/story.html", "referrer"=>["google.ca", "facebook.com", "google.com", "direct", "google.com.au"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1nBYcK6", "lastseen"=>"20140726004527", "page"=>"http://www.theprovince.com/news/penticton+nude+beach+roils+waters+okanagan+lake/10060211/story.html", "ogtitle"=>"Penticton nude beach row roils waters of Okanagan Lake"}, {"domain"=>"wlbz2.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406328346000", "h3"=>["Bucksport daycare forced to temporarily close", "Sent!", "Posted!"], "site"=>"www.wlbz2.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004322", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335402572", "title"=>"Bucksport daycare forced to temporarily close", "initial"=>"20140725224546", "summaryText"=>"BUCKSPORT, Maine (NEWS CENTER) -- A Bucksport daycare was forced by the Department of Health and Human Services to close its doors for ten days after an incident at the local swimming pool.

The Old Trafford club are believed to have put together a £39 million bid for the midfielder, as Louis Van Gaal looks to install some aggression back into their ranks. Juventus are believed to be unwilling to sell the Chilean international, but the latest developments could prove too tempting to turn down. TalkSPORT and Tuttosport understand that the Red Devils are not willing to stretch beyond the £40 million mark, however, and should their latest approach be rebuffed, then they will drop out of the race to sign Vidal entirely. From the player’s perspective, although his club do not want him to leave Turin, it is believed that Vidal would favour a move to Manchester United.

The 32-year-old Warminster man, George Kaucher, followed his attacker, describing the red Mack truck to Bucks County emergency dispatchers. Lower Makefield police eventually caught up with the truck just before it entered southbound I-95, according to Newtown Township police. The incident happened shortly before 8:30 a.m. at the intersection of the Newtown Bypass (Route 332) and Newtown-Richboro Road. Laurence Fuller, of Voorhees, climbed onto the side of the Kaucher's vehicle and started yelling obscenities at him, a probable cause affidavit states. The court paperwork did not describe why Fuller jumped onto Kaucher's vehicle. Kaucher tried to get Fuller off his truck by opening the door. But Fuller continued yelling and started walking toward the back of the Kaucher’s vehicle, police said. Kaucher followed Fuller behind the truck and then Fuller started punching him “wildly” in the head and face, police said. Kaucher estimated Fuller punched him five times leaving him feeling dizzy, the affidavit said. An officer at the scene said Kaucher had a swollen left eye that appeared red and watery and redness on his face, head and neck. Kaucher was treated at St. Mary Medical Center and released, a spokeswoman said. Fuller was arraigned before Morrisville District Judge Michael Burns on charges of aggravated and simple assault, as well as disorderly conduct.

The refunds are from a provision in the Affordable Care Act called the \"Medical Loss Ratio rule\" or the \"80/20 rule,\" which says insurers have to spent at least 80 percent of premiums on actual health care or wellness programs, not on profits or bureaucracy. Those who miss the targets have to issue refund by sending checks, discounting future premiums or by other means. Some of the refunds have already been made. Most of the Montana refunds (about $1.7 million) are coming from Time Insurance Co. Other refunds are coming from the John Alden Life Insurance Co. (which, like Time Insurance, is part of Assurant, a New York-based family of health plans); Madison National Life Insurance Co.; MEGA Life and Health Insurance Co.; and Trustmark Life Insurance Co.

An officer noticed a small boy in a Jeep Wrangler by himself in Myrtle Creek, Oregon. After about five minutes and not seeing any adults, the officer approached the child and asked about his parents. The boy said his parents weren't home, but another relative was asleep in the house, according to a Myrtle Creek police report. Police contacted the relative, identified as 22-year-old Brennan Pennington, and alerted her to the fact that the child had the keys in the Jeep and was able to get inside the vehicle. Police said the officer issued a warning to Pennington. The family, however, said that wasn't the case. The boy's aunt and owner of the Jeep, Amy Mayberry, told Fox 12 on Thursday night that the child never had the keys, because they were inside the home the whole time and never within his reach. She said the boy got into the vehicle while Pennington was in the bathroom.  At about 7:30 p.m., police were called back to the scene on reports of a Jeep crashing into a house. Investigators said the 3-year-old again got into the Jeep, only this time he knocked it out of gear. Witnesses reported seeing the Jeep traveling down the street, through an intersection, up over a curb, through a yard and into a house. The boy then got out, wearing only a diaper, and ran home, according to Myrtle Creek police. The officer arrived at the child's home and said the boy was on the couch watching cartoons, \"as if nothing had ever happened.\" Mayberry said the whole thing was simply a big accident. She said the jeep was parked on an incline and when the boy got inside and was playing around, he knocked the manual transmission into neutral, causing the vehicle to coast down the road and into a home. Nobody was injured.  Police said the family made a \"civil compromise\" with the homeowner regarding the damage to the house. Pennington was cited on the charge of failing to supervise a child, according to police.", "score"=>160.25546, "summaryTitle"=>"Police: 3-year-old in diapers crashes Jeep", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"A 3-year-old boy is accused of climbing into a Jeep, knocking it out of gear, crashing into a nearby house and then running home to watch cartoons.", "cities"=>"us-nh", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.wmur.com/police-3yearold-in-diapers-crashes-jeep/27145304", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/UyndKJ", "lastseen"=>"20140726004353", "page"=>"http://www.wmur.com/police-3yearold-in-diapers-crashes-jeep/27145304", "ogtitle"=>"Police: 3-year-old in diapers crashes Jeep"}, {"domain"=>"thelisticles.net", "initial_epoch"=>"1406331037000", "h2"=>"15 EPIC but NSFW Life Hacks", "h3"=>["1 of 15", "Join the Discussion"], "site"=>"thelisticles.net", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004731", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335651240", "title"=>"15 EPIC but NSFW Life Hacks", "initial"=>"20140725233037", "summaryText"=>"Join the Discussion", "content"=>"Join the Discussion", "score"=>160.2478, "summaryTitle"=>"15 EPIC but NSFW Life Hacks", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://thelisticles.net/nsfw-hacks/455482/", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1o0HG1V", "lastseen"=>"20140726004722", "page"=>"http://thelisticles.net/nsfw-hacks/455482/", "ogtitle"=>"15 EPIC but NSFW Life Hacks"}, {"domain"=>"mesmerizingquotes.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406331030000", "h3"=>" Related Articles", "site"=>"www.mesmerizingquotes.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004335", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335415478", "title"=>"Walk away immediately from anything that gives you bad vibes | Mesmerizing Quotes", "initial"=>"20140725233030", "summaryText"=>"Not good to keep those things in your life that drag you down.

Surround yourself with positive and supportive people and things.  If you know what’s right from wrong you could sense it right away if you need to stay or leave. I always trust my gut feeling, it’s God’s way to protect me from harm. ~ Connie Brown  When I get bad vibes, my habit is to tell myself I’m being paranoid, ridiculous,etc. ‘BUT,’ I think I’m getting past this. ~ Carrie Barber  If I make a mistake of expressing that I have a concern that comes from intuition, I am told by others that I am being negative. I try to not live by my fears, but most often I find out I should have listened to that “voice.” ~ Amy Carles  The difference is whether the feeling came before the thoughts (intuition), or the thought before the feeling (paranoia). Sometimes the feelings are even there with no real thoughts as to why. You just know something’s off. Trust that. Just don’t jump to the conclusion that you know the specific reason. ~ Loretta Curtis  This knowledge comes regrettably a bit late in the day to salvage and restore all that I’ve lost through a blunder of my own making. If I knew then what I know now, I would have dutifully listened to my inner voice, guided by my gut instincts, followed my intuition and sixth sense to the letter, then I wouldn’t be enduring the sorry consequence of my pitifully misjudged inaction. Suffice to say, the experience had been a mighty harsh, costly and painstaking lesson in the learning and am still paying the steep price of my negligence and lack of judgement. Nevertheless, the regrets I have to live with forever more will serve as a constant and painful reminder never to ignore the writing on the wall with the blatantly obvious truth staring one in the eye and acknowledge, unquestionably whatever message and signal your inner voice is trying to impart. The blame is solely mine as surely as is the tragic price exacted for my wilful ignorance. ~ Margaret Young  Share your thoughts on what this post means to you... comments", "score"=>160.24226,

Make these small changes to your beauty routine and that’s what you’ll get… July 25, 2014 1 Add coconut oil to your moisturising routine It'll help hydrate and improve skin condition. \"Research demonstrates how good", "content"=>"Who doesn’t want better skin and hair? Make these small changes to your beauty routine and that’s what you’ll get… July 25, 2014 1 Add coconut oil to your moisturising routine It'll help hydrate and improve skin condition. \"Research demonstrates how good virgin coconut oil is as a moisturiser,\" says Mara Evangelista, who’s studies on the oil have been printed in the International Journal of Dermatology . \"It’s affordable, effective, and especially helpful for the older population, when skin dryness is a pressing problem.\" Plus with Emma Stone and Gwyneth Paltrow among the A-listers using it, we’re happy to give it a try. 2 Only wash your face once a day Turns out washing your face morning and night could actually be detrimental for your skin. Unless you have a skin condition, like acne, some dermatologists recommend only washing it in the evening (to remove makeup, pollutants and other dirt). Why? Washing twice a day can cause skin to become dry. 3 Regularly exercise Working out isn’t just good for your health but also your skin as it increases blood flow and blood flow helps the body rid toxins. \"Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to working cells throughout the body, including the skin,\" explains dermatologist Ellen Marmur, author of Simple Skin Beauty: Every Woman's Guide to a Lifetime of Healthy, Gorgeous Skin . \"By increasing blood flow, a bout of exercise helps flush cellular debris out of the system.” Surely that’s added motivation to get up to get up and run. 4 Sleep for at least seven hours It’s called beauty sleep for a reason. In a study by the University Hospitals Case Medical Centre in Cleveland Ohio, those who got less than five hours of sleep each night for at least a month had higher ratings of fine lines, uneven pigmentation, slackening elasticity and impaired skin-barrier function compared to those who got over seven hours a night. 5 Sleep on your back \"If you sleep face-down the blood vessels will become constricted and the circulatory system releases congested fluid from tiny flaps in the walls of these vessels,\" says Colette Haydon, a doctor of pharmacy and dermo-cosmetology at University of Lyon, France. Translation: sleeping with your face in your pillow can cause dark circles and puffiness. 6 Fill up on fruit and veg for brighter skin A study at the University of Nottingham in 2011 found that people who ate more portions of fruit and vegetable per day had a more golden skin colour. This is due to carotenoids which give produce its pigmentation. Carotenoids are found in peaches, pumpkins, apricots, spinach and carrots, so eat up. 7 Eat more tomatoes Lycopene, a pigment found in tomatoes, has been found to significantly protect skin from UV damage. 8 Your hair needs to slip, slop, slap too Just as the sun damages you skin it also affects your locks. Covering your hair when you’re in the sun will protect it against UV damage (which can lead to weak and broken strands). 9 Moisture straight after washing Moisturisers work by trapping existing water into the skin by preventing it from evaporating. So the more water captured the better - applying moisturiser within three minutes of turning off the tap will ensure maximum hydration.

While the original outing received the most attention, Twitchers have been rambling their way through the series and are poised to attack the most recently released entry, Pokémon X . Sure, there's no workable emulator on which to play the game through Twitch, but that's only a speed bump of a fact on the Victory Road of Mass Lunacy. dekuNukem, the modder who created a \"Shiny Pokémon Finder\" , has focused his special set of skills and created a streaming 3DS that can be controlled by external inputs. According to a brief interview with Destructoid , dekuNukem is happy not just to let such technology fall into Twitch's hands, but provide even more routes of interactivity through the 3DS online connection: ...it's a great honor that I can contribute to the community and using the experience to make TPPX possible on a real 3DS. And since the game is running on a real 3DS, wireless connectivity will enable stream players to battle or trade with strangers around the world, and passerby are able to influence the stream by offering O-Power or trading. All in all, I believe that the last TPP is something really special, and online interaction with real players around the world will play a non-neglectable role during the course of TPPX. You can view the Frankenstein's monstrosity in all its glory within the video below: The Twitch Plays Pokémon channel is set to depart from Vaniville Town on 26th July at 9 p.m. Pacific Time. In the meantime, they've been driving villagers mad in Animal Crossing: New Leaf . Will you take part in the newest massive multiplayer Pokémon journey? Do you dare challenge thousands upon thousands of chatroom mashers to a battle? Let us know below.

Jerry Brown signed legislation Friday that allows students at accredited medical school programs in California to complete their education and become doctors in three years instead of four. The goal of Assembly Bill 1838 by Assemblywoman Susan Bonilla from Concord is to churn quality doctors out faster with less student debt. The bill comes at a time when demand for doctors is high due to federal health reform. AB 1838 was sponsored by the University of California — which operates six medical schools in the state — and the Medical Board of California , which regulates, licenses and disciplines doctors. Accelerated programs focus on individual skills and academic achievement instead of the length of time students are in school. The idea is to offer an alternate track, not replace traditional medical school. Only students who demonstrate a high level of scientific and medical understanding are eligible for accelerated programs. “Currently California faces an extreme shortage of trained medical residents and physicians,” Bonilla said in a news release. “AB 1838 is an innovative step towards addressing this problem and meeting the needs of our communities without diminishing the quality of patient care.” The bill takes effect in January 2015, but a pilot program is already underway. The UC Davis School of Medicine is working with Kaiser Permanente on the first accelerated medical education program in California. The first group of six students started classes in June. Dr. Hillary Campbell , director of the accelerated primary-care program, said Kaiser was pleased the bill was signed. \"It's an important first step to address California's primary-care physician shortage and will allow students to graduate medical school and enter the work force a year sooner with a comprehensive and full medical education and less debt. We look forward to continuing our partnership with UC Davis for many years to come.\" Kathy Robertson covers health care, law and lobbying, labor, workplace issues and immigration for the Sacramento Business Journal.", "score"=>160.1661, "summaryTitle"=>"Governor signs bill to let doctors graduate faster", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Gov.

South Carolina Commerce Department officials confirmed reports that the brewer decided against sites in our state that included Lexington and Greenville. Stone Brewing Company is the 10th largest brewer in the nation and is looking to add a facility closer to the East Coast. The facility is expected to bring around $31 million in investments from Stone and could deliver 400 new jobs for the state that lands the deal. South Carolina lawmakers passed what was dubbed as the \"Stone Bill\" this session to lure the company. The change in law allows breweries to sell unlimited quantities of beer on sites with restaurant service. The new law also allows brewers to sell beverages other than their own beer. Previous laws limited how much beer a brewery could sell on site. Allison Skipper, Director of Marketing Communications at the Commerce Department, told News19 in an email: \"I will say that because of the new law passed this session, South Carolina is now well-positioned to win these kinds of projects in the future. Also, the law enables our existing brewing businesses to have additional expansion options, which supports new jobs and brings economic impact to our state.\"", "score"=>160.1002, "summaryTitle"=>"Stone Brewing Company Will Not Build in SC", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Columbia, SC (WLTX) -- Stone Brewery Company will not build a new production facility in South Carolina.

Medics carried out an emergency C-section to save the baby’s life after her mother died on the operating table. The 23-year-old woman was killed after the airstrike hit a house in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah. Accordin to Al Jazeera’s report on the attack , there were four families inside the two-storey building when it was struck in the middle of the night. Dr Fadi Al-Khrote, one of the medics who saved the baby, said he believed “what’s happened is a miracle” as the infant’s mother had been dead for around ten minutes before the operation could be completed. He said it was generally the case that if the mother was dead for more than five minutes, her baby would die too. The little girl’s chances of survival are rated at 50/50 by the doctors, according to the BBC . US Network ABC News reports that the child’s father, who is believed to be associated with the group Islamic Jihad, has gone into hiding. The strikes took the Palestinian death toll in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive on July 8 to 865. Rockets and mortar rounds fired into Israel have killed three civilians — two Israelis and a Thai farm worker — and fighting in and around Gaza has killed 35 Israeli soldiers. Human rights watchdogs say that some 80 percent of the Palestinian dead have been civilians, many of them women or children. Includes reporting from AFP.

After I posted it , the upvotes slowly began to trickle in. Within the hour it had amassed around 4000 upvotes, peaking at around 6500 and holding the top spot for a long while. Recognition! Sweet, sweet recognition! It felt great. For many aspiring enthusiasts, the notion of having even a single one of your photos get so many positive reactions is a worthy aim, and I admit that I would probably be jealous of anyone who had it happen to them. In fact, I already had been. That jealousy was likely the final catalyst in the decision to post it. Normally I wouldn’t post one of my photos in that manner. The “Fuji shot” had already made a splash, having been licensed by Bing Japan for their background image of the day, in July of 2013. It had also been my first competition win, having won 1st prize in Getty Image’s national “A Moment Connecting – Japan” entry. With that came a little bit of a headache, as it meant that people were now able to download my image and use it as they liked. It turned up on a few “foreign buzzfeed”-style sites, a couple of “free desktop background” offerings and had made the rounds on Tumblr. Nothing too bad, but at the time it felt like the crime of the century. I spent about a week or so chasing up these sites in order to have credit noted or the image taken down, but after having very little response from any of the websites, I decided to admit defeat, and go with the notion that if the image was going to be shared, it was going to be on my own terms – and hey, I could enjoy a bit of an ego boost if it got popular. Having learnt my lesson on being so liberal with my original-resolution jpeg, I uploaded a very low-res version to Imgur for the Reddit post. Posting it meant it would be shared a lot more – that much was obvious, but I figured that no-one could do a lot with such a small image. Which brings me to the first important thing I learned from posting my photo to Reddit’s /r/pics: #1. People will do a lot with a small image After the post had sat at the number one spot for a few hours, someone notified me that a Facebook page belonging to “Distractify” (a media sharing site) had displayed the image. I checked it out and true enough, it was there for all to see, with no mention of me or my websites. It had been shared 874 times at the time I found it, and there were close to 100 comments. I added one alerting them that this was my image and to contact me immediately. What followed were various comments telling me that it was my fault for putting it online, that I should be grateful, and that my street-portraits were hosted online without the subjects permission, so I was just as bad (whole other can of worms). With no response from Distractify, I PMed them on Facebook, e-mailed them and tweeted them. I didn’t get a response until I issued a DMCA takedown via FB itself, at which point I got a cheery message from Distractify saying “Thanks! We’ll credit you now or we can take it down – whatever works for you.” Well, two things. Firstly, by this time (at least 12 hours later) their post had already been buried under numerous new ones. The damage had been done. Secondly, the post had already been removed. Not sure what happened there. I am sure the image has been posted on a wealth of other “content” sites, but I haven’t the energy to check. The damage has been done. At least it was only a low-res image, though. Can’t do much with that. Anyway, second thing I learned… #2. People will get the full-res image anyway Huh. So Flickr has some security leaks. Even though I’d disabled access to my full-res image, Redditors soon began posting it in response to others asking for a desktop version. As some of you know, this is doable by viewing the page’s source code and finding the file. After that its a simple copy+paste job and a right-click to get it. My wife was lovely enough to ask users to remove their links, explaining that it enabled the image to be used in ways I wasn’t ok with. Most of them complied within a good few hours. Some didn’t. Either way, the damage had been done. #3. People won’t believe its your own photo This one is relatively short, but I still found it bizarre. I’d say about 20 users posted results from reverse-google-image-search, such as screenshots of the results or my website and Flickr. They’d say things like: Climbed Mt. Fuji, huh? So you are Kris J B, owner of THIS WEBSITE and THIS FLICKR who took this photo TWO YEARS AGO? Yeah right. Y.. Yeah? The image is already online… Why is it a surprise that a photographer would post his images online? I don’t understand the karma-whore witch-hunt ethic. Karma is absolutely useless. This third point is important because it taught me that I will get seriously stressed out if people start accusing me of photo-thievery. One chap was adamant that the image was actually from 2009, because Google’s reverse-search had presented the subReddit /r/woahdude , created in 2009, where my photo had been reposted. He would not listen to reason. He accused me of lying through my teeth and that I was stealing someone else’s hard-earned work. I didn’t like that. I got so stressed I had trouble sleeping. Gotta be careful to ignore the trolls. Moving on #4. The recognition you gain will not be very fruitful Here are the visitation stats from my website : Outstanding! 20,000 people visited my site! Some people even messaged me asking if they could buy a print! … I have not heard anything more. I did not sell anything. Oh well, at least my other images got exposure…? Not really. As you can see, nearly everyone who visited my site came for the original image, maybe scrolled once or twice through others in that set, then left. The shop page didn’t even make it into the top ten most-visited. Now, I didn’t post this with the intention of making money, but after seeing the visit count I was over the moon. I thought to myself “If I make one sale, I’ll be a happy chappy!” but alas. No big deal. Oh, and my photography page on Facebook went up by 4 likes. I am considering that a win, no matter how small. I consider those 4 extra likes genuine fans. It’s a win. It has made me greatly question the value of digital portfolios, however. I used to carry my portfolio on an iPad when visiting restaurants or bars with the intention of selling wall art, and had my heart sink as they idly swipe past each image without really looking. Luckily, however, I switched to a printed portfolio which ensures the audience gives each image reverence – and I made two sales from this method! Why I probably shouldn’t have posted it So I learned a lot from the last 24 hours. The damage has been done and I’ll probably see “that Fuji shot” posted on all sorts of Buzzfeed wannabe sites when I finally dare to reverse-google it… But still, those are some valuable lessons I learned. AND I had a lovely time talking with all the interested users, Fuji-climbers and photographers. So why do I regret it? Because 30% of the 1000 responses that filled my inbox were just the word “illuminati” and it made me want to pray for a meteor strike. That is not a nice feeling. Oh my god, Reddit main subs can be annoying holy s**t. Good night. Followup : Let it be known these were my 100% honest thoughts fresh after the nuttiness of the proceeding 24 hours after posting the photo to/r/pics, and that I have a much more positive outlook on the whole situation as of now. It has, after all, brought great attention to my work, but more importantly it’s taught me a great deal about the nature of digital media and marketing oneself online, which is something I knew nothing at all before this (as it is embarrassingly clear from this writing).

However, there are some out there that are often overlooked, such as Snapchat , which has quickly become a hidden gem that businesses can use to help make their organizations more successful. A number of businesses are already taking advantage of Snapchat, including but not limited to Taco Bell, Acura, and frozen yogurt chain 16 Handles. You might be wondering how exactly these brands are using Snapchat, particularly because the app is a messaging service and not visual like the other social networks. Acura used Snapchat by sending a “snap” of its new NSX prototype car to its first 100 followers. The company than subsequently released the video on other networks such as Vine. Snapchat is very useful in this way because it builds a demand for the product, whatever it may be, and limits the pool of people who can view it. In turn, those 100 people will share what they saw with others via word of mouth and buzz for the product will be created. Snapchat is powerful in this way because it connects brands directly with users, and doesn’t rely on the possibility that they may not see the image or video they post, such as on Facebook and Twitter. Instead, it sends the content in the form of a direct message that has to be viewed before it can be removed from the user’s queue. This is a great way for small businesses to utilize because it is a way of letting the product do its own marketing and a great way for companies to directly target consumers. Just because other businesses are using Snapchat differently doesn’t mean that you aren’t able to use it as well. You can target consumers for your small business by using Snapchat in a more tightly integrated space. For example, 16 Handles asked users to snap a picture of themselves at one of the many locations and the company sent the customers back a coupon for a discount on their products. This is more direct and works well because it makes customers feel as if they are part of the company. On Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, customers are able to see the comments of other customers so when a brand posts a promotion such as the one 16 Handles did, the thread of comments gets slightly disorganized. Snapchat is a simple, clean, and direct way of reaching your target market and shows that your business is truly ahead of the curve. Wouldn’t it be better for a consumer to be able to see your product in action in a direct message with no distractions?

Last quarter, Microsoft sold nearly one million more phones than Apple did. And it has the numbers to prove it. That information came to light during Microsoft's earnings call earlier this week. And it's a result of its purchase of Nokia. In a slide detailing sales of phone hardware during the quarter, it said that it sold 5.8 million Lumia Windows Phones, and 30.3 million \"non-Lumia devices.\" Those non-Lumia devices are what are gently called feature phones, but are really dumb phones. Nokia still has sizable feature-phone sales. That means all told, Microsoft sold 36.1 million phones in the quarter. As Neowin points out, that means that Microsoft sold more phones than did Apple in the quarter, because Apple sold 35.2 million iPhones. On paper, that might sound impressive. But in the real world, it means next to nothing. Nokia's market share is plummeting, and smartphones are the future, not feature phones. It's likely that last quarter will be the last time that Microsoft will outsell Apple in the phone market. In addition, smartphones are the gift that keeps on giving, because each phone leads to additional revenue, via services such as OneDrive and Skype, or in Apple's case, the App Store.

That’s the equivalent of about two extra portions of fruit and vegetables a day, with no increase in caloric intake. Are organic foods really healthier than non-organic foods? Are organic foods really healthier than non-organic foods? Researchers from Newcastle University in England have reviewed and conducted meta-analysis on 343 peer-reviewed scientific studies in an effort to find out if organic foods contained greater nutritional value than conventional foods. The results will probably shock some, but will confirm what many people already knew; organic foods are indeed much healthier for human consumption than ‘conventional’ foods. This settles the debate over organic foods once and for all! The most important difference that researchers found was that organic foods contain a much higher amount of antioxidants than conventional crops. Antioxidants prevent oxidation in the body which combats certain diseases and cancers. “Consumers who switch to organic fruit, vegetables and cereals would get 20 to 40 percent more antioxidants. That’s the equivalent of about two extra portions of fruit and vegetables a day, with no increase in caloric intake.” The researchers also found pesticide residues were three to four times more likely in conventional foods than organic ones, as organic farmers are not allowed to apply toxic, synthetic pesticides. While crops harvested from organically managed fields sometimes contain pesticide residues, the levels are usually 10-fold to 100-fold lower in organic food, compared to the corresponding, conventionally grown food.     Read more: Major study documents benefits of organic farming Image credit: AP    ", "score"=>159.9591, "summaryTitle"=>"Scientists Reviewed 343 Studies to see if Organic Food is Better for you.

Feike and I returned to the house to find our two and four year old Noah and Zephy but the hot vapor immediately caught our hair ears clothes ablaze……….I lingered unable to enter my melting house until I stopped hearing my babies cough….I screamed for them but they were gone…..I thank you Lord for taking them quickly …..peace over came me knowing they were no longer struggling……..God gave us the strength to walk away for our lives to be spared……..pray for Gods will to be done, Pray for our ever aching hearts filled will guilt and anger at ourselves for not being able to reach them….pray that we may cling to one another and our beloved Father in heaven….pray for my son Able grieving his best friends…….I love you all and I though you should know what happened.

It’s real, says ABC News Australia : One of the world’s major kale seed suppliers says it has run out of every variety of the trendy vegetable. “You could describe it as embarrassing to us, but it’s just one of those things that’s happened on a global basis,” Tony Hubbard from Bejo Seeds, which is based in the Netherlands, said. “Kale suppliers say rapid rise of vegetable’s popularity is leading to worldwide shortage” will sure sell papers, although the article itself appears to be more of an opportunity for farmers to boast about how popular their cabbage-like crop has become (it’s “really exciting but really scary at the same time,” per one farmer.) Evidence of a worldwide shortage, in this case, is scant. Still, a kale shortage! It’s easy to make light of such a situation (Modern Farmer does so gloriously) , especially because, at this point, it doesn’t seem to be much of a situation at all. By all indications, National Kale Day 2014 should still be a happy occasion. But the farmers’ “concerns” can also be read as a cautionary tale about what can happen when foodstuffs become too trendy for their own good. Chef and author Dan Barber spoke at length about this phenomenon in a recent Salon interview : “I came to the conclusion that the problem with all this is we root around looking for  the  diet or  the  food fad that’s going to make us feel healthy and look good and be sustainable at the same time,” he explained. “We have Paleo diets, and we have these cockamamie ideas of what the world can support because it’s in fashion or because it shows to be working for the short term, but that will last about as long as the conversation and then we’ll be on to something else. Unfortunately, the land can’t support those diets…” Kale is good, and it’s definitely good for you — let’s just avoid the “all kale all the time” attitude. Otherwise, we risk turning it into a bad thing. Lindsay Abrams is an assistant editor at Salon, focusing on all things sustainable. Follow her on Twitter @readingirl, email labrams@salon.com.

But yesterday, the 22-year-old revealed a different mindset to the world: The Bosnian-born, Australian-raised stunner came out as a transgender woman, announced a name change to Andreja Pejic (with a gold nameplate necklace to match), and granted three interviews detailing her completed sexual reassignment surgery. Speaking exclusively to Style.com, People , and Entertainment Tonight , Pejic revealed she's always planned to transition to becoming a woman, telling Style.com \"but now I\u0092m taking that step because I\u0092m a little older\u0097I\u0092m 22\u0097and I think my story can help people.\" We certainly think it can and applaud Pejic for being so brave in telling her story so publicly. Each interview reveals different details about Pejic's story, so they're all worth reading (or watching, in the case of Entertainment Tonight ): As is Pejic's Instagram post from yesterday: \"I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you for the love and support throughout the years. You've all helped me through this journey and I have learned a lot and really come into my own and the response to today\u0092s announcement truly overwhelmed me and reminds me of why I chose to do this publicly. I think we all evolve as we get older and that's normal but I like to think that my recent transition hasn't made me into a different individual. Same person, no difference at all just a different sex I hope you can all understand that.\" \"I would also like to to reach out to all young gender non-conforming youth out there: I know it's hard, I've been there, but remember it\u0092s your right to be accepted as what you identify with---you deserve the same respect as any other human being on this planet. As a transgender woman I hope to show that after transition (a life-saving process) one can be happy and successful in their new chapter without having to alienate their past.

Yep, us too. The thing is, some aren't nearly as good for you—or your waistline—as their packaging would have you believe. So we turned to Jaclyn London, M.S., R.D., senior clinical dietician at Mount Sinai Hospital, to shed some much-needed light on which ingredients you should skip if you're trying to drop pounds. Here are the ones she says you should put on your do-not-buy list: Coconut Oil Coconut oil has recently become the hottest trend in everything from cooking to beauty treatments, but London cautions that two tablespoons of coconut oil contain about 200 calories and 16 grams of heart-clogging saturated fat (about 80 percent of our recommended daily value!). So if you start using this product regularly without otherwise adjusting your diet, you'll likely start to see weight creep. Gluten-Free Products First it was \"fat-free.\" Then, it was \"low-carb.\" Now, \"gluten-free\" is showing up on all sorts of food products. \"There's nothing necessarily healthier about gluten-free pasta when compared to regular pasta,\" says London. \"In fact, it's likely lower in protein and fiber than its whole-wheat alternative.\" The same goes for breads, cookies, and other products with gluten-free versions. The calorie counts of similar products usually remain the same, but you may eat more of them since gluten-free products typically have a health halo. So unless you're suffering from celiac disease, you're not doing yourself any favors opting for a gluten-free product. MORE: Gluten-Free Foods That Make You Gain Weight Vegan Cheese This is another example where you might assume the alternative version has fewer calories than the original—but it doesn’t. \"It sounds like a healthier choice, but it still has about 100 calories per ounce, just like regular cheese, and is loaded with fake ingredients such as starch, xanthan gum, and protein isolates,\" says London. Additionally, you're losing the protein-rich benefit of the real deal: String cheese has eight grams of protein, whereas a serving of vegan cheese contains about one gram of protein—so you won’t even fill as full from each serving. Agave Nectar This sweetener is often touted as natural and organic, but pure agave nectar is virtually unheard of. Instead, the bottles you'll find on store shelves are filled with chemically produced syrups that contain more man-made sugar than the dreaded high fructose corn syrup. \"The issue is, once it's labeled a healthy food, people use it like it's calorie-free and pour it on everything,\" says London. \"In fact, it has 45 calories per teaspoon.\" Want something sweet (and waistline-friendly) in tomorrow’s coffee? Try a dash of cinnamon instead. Tomato Sauce \"Tomato sauce can be a healthy, low-calorie cooking addition, but it's another one where label reading is key,\" says London. Many tomato sauce brands contain added sugar and tons of sodium—which basically adds up to unnecessary calories and bloating.  Brown Sugar \"Brown, white, liquid—doesn't matter,\" says London. Sugar is sugar is sugar, and it packs 16 calories per teaspoon. So make sure to be just as mindful when you're adding brown sugar to your coffee as when you’re adding table sugar; otherwise, you could end up taking in an excessive number of calories. MORE: What It's Like to Go a Year Without Sugar Carob Carob is often touted as a more healthful alternative to chocolate, but in reality, it contains the same number of calories (150 per one-ounce serving)—and it lacks the health benefits linked to modest chocolate intake (including lowering your risk of obesity and heart disease). \"The only difference is that they are derived from different plants, so carob is caffeine-free, which can be beneficial to people who are sensitive to the stimulant effects of caffeine,\" says London. But if you're trying to lose weight, you'll want to limit your intake of both carob and chocolate.

For years, Native Americans have been stereotyped by the media. Specifically, their culturally and spiritually significant headdress that has somehow become an insensitive fashion statement. Photo: Elle Magazine Photo: One Direction Photo: Getty But more than just models and musicians, the headdress has become synonymous with most music festivals — like Coachella — that’ve already taken a lot of heat for Native appropriation. Remember these guys? Photo: melanysguydlines.com Photo: Daylife Images Photo: Noisey Photo: GQ The organizers of Bass Coast made a decision to ban Native American headdresses, releasing a statement that said, “For various reasons, Bass Coast Festival is banning feathered war bonnets, or anything resembling them, on-site. Our security team will be enforcing this policy.” They went on to say, “We understand why people are attracted to war bonnets. They have a magnificent aesthetic. But their spiritual, cultural and aesthetic significance cannot be separated.” Organizers met with aboriginal people in order to align the event’s policies with their wishes. They wrote, “Bass Coast Festival takes place on indigenous land and we respect the dignity of aboriginal people. We have consulted aboriginal people in British Columbia on this issue, and we feel our policy aligns with their views and wishes regarding the subject. Their opinion is what matters to us.” Although Native Americans are seldom shown mass public respect, this festival’s headdress ban is one of many in the right direction. The Redskins football team may have to change their name after the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office cancelled their trademarks — one of the first steps the government has taken in addressing disparaging acts towards Native Americans. It’s encouraging to see society taking small strides in respecting Native Peoples, but it’s not enough. Canada’s award-winning EDM aboriginal collective called A Tribe Called Red has spoken out about the headdress issue recently, telling the Huffington Post , “It’s ‘redface.’ Just like blackface. We’re in the middle of our civil-rights movement right now, today. So hopefully, in a couple decades, redface and terms like ‘Redskin’ and ‘Indian’ will go away the way blackface and terms like ‘nigger’ have become tabooed.” It’s time that we make greater efforts in recognizing Native Americans and providing platforms for them to advocate on behalf of their communities and cultures. As A Tribe Called Red said, their civil rights movement is now, and we must honor that. And as far as music festivals go, there may not be headdresses, but don’t worry, there will still be plenty of this: Photo: Swide And this: Photo: Bass Coast And of course, this: Photo: Pique news magazine  ", "score"=>159.53604, "summaryTitle"=>"A Popular Music Festival Just Banned Something Major", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Headresses will be banned at this year&#039;s Bass Coast Festival in Canada, and we&#039;re glad.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.ryot.org/bass-coast-festival-bans-headdresses-tickets/767025", "referrer"=>["google.com", "t.co", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1rG06fW", "lastseen"=>"20140726004615", "page"=>"http://www.ryot.org/bass-coast-festival-bans-headdresses-tickets/767025", "ogtitle"=>"A Popular Music Festival Just Banned Something Major - RYOT News"}, {"domain"=>"app.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406332895000", "h3"=>["Two arrested in Keansburg raid, pound of pot found", "Sent!", "Posted!"], "site"=>"www.app.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004804", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335684249", "title"=>"Two arrested in Keansburg raid, pound of pot found", "initial"=>"20140726000135", "summaryText"=>"KEANSBURG – Armed with a federal bench warrant, law enforcement officers descended on a Seeley Avenue apartment looking for a woman, but instead arrested her boyfriend, borough police reported.

Authorities from Keansburg police and the U.S. Marshal’s Office went to 173 Seeley Ave. at about 2 p.m. Thursday to arrest 20-year-old Alexandrea Burke, said Deputy Chief Michael Pigott of the Keansburg force. Burke was not there. However, authorities did find her boyfriend, 23-year-old Joseph Pontone, and more than one pound of marijuana and evidence that drugs were being dealt in a park zone, Pigott said. While searching the apartment for Burke, authorities discovered Pontone in his room with the marijuana in his possession, Pigott said. The marijuana was all packaged in separate baggies with various weights. The officers also found $3,320 in cash, a heat-sealing machine used to package the marijuana and a scale. Pontone was charged with possession of more than 50 grams of marijuana, possession of more than one ounce of marijuana but less than 5 pounds with the intent to distribute, and possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute in a park zone, police said. Pontone’s mother, Debra Edelman, 57, who lives with him, was charged with hindering the apprehension of another. She was released on a summons. Later Thursday, Burke was arrested by the marshals in the Highlands, police said. Pontone was being held at Keansburg police headquarters pending the setting of bail.

But,", "content"=>"The global financial crisis that erupted in full force in 2008 affected Europe and the United States in a very similar way – at least at the start. On both sides of the Atlantic, economic performance tanked in 2009 and started to recover in 2010. But, as the financial crisis mutated into the euro crisis, an economic gulf opened between the US and the eurozone. Over the past three years (2011-2013),  the US economy grew  by about six percentage points more. Even taking into account the increasing demographic differential, which now amounts to about half a percentage point per year,  the US economy has grown  by about 4.5 percentage points more over these three years on a  per capita  basis. The main reason for the gap is the difference in  private consumption , which grew in the US, but fell in the eurozone, especially in its periphery. A retrenchment of  public consumption  actually subtracted more demand in the US (0.8 percentage points) than in the European Union (0.1 points). This might appear to be somewhat surprising in light of all of the talk about Brussels’ imposed austerity. In fact, public consumption in the eurozone has  de facto  remained fairly constant over the last three years, whereas it has declined substantially in the US. (The same is true of public investment, though this constitutes such a small proportion of GDP that transatlantic differences could not have had a large impact on growth over a three-year horizon.) The contraction of private investment in Europe accounts for only a small part (one-third) of the growth gap. Though the financial-market tensions that accompanied the euro crisis had a strong negative impact on investment in the eurozone periphery, investment demand has also remained weak in the US, minimizing the overall difference. The resilience of private consumption in the US, the key to the growth gap, is not surprising, given that American households have reduced their  debt burden  considerably from the peak of more than 90% of GDP reached just before the crisis. The lower debt burden is also a key reason why consumption is expected to continue to grow much faster in the US than in the eurozone this year and next. But the crucial question – and one that is rarely asked – is how US households were able to reduce their debt burden during a period of high unemployment and almost no wage gains while sustaining consumption growth. The answer lies in a combination of “no recourse” mortgages and fast bankruptcy procedures. Millions of American homes that were purchased with subprime mortgages have been foreclosed in recent years, forcing their owners, unable to service their debt, to leave. But, as a result of no-recourse mortgages in many US states, the entire mortgage debt was then extinguished, even if the value of the home was too low to cover the balance still due. Moreover, even in those states where there is full recourse, so that the homeowner remains liable for the full amount of the mortgage loan (that is, the difference between the balance due and the value recovered by selling the home), America’s procedures for personal bankruptcy offer a relatively quick solution. Millions of Americans have  filed for personal bankruptcy  since 2008 , thereby extinguishing their personal debt. The same applies to  hundreds of thousands of small businesses . Of course, there has also been a surge of bankruptcies in the eurozone’s periphery. But in countries like Italy, Spain and Greece, the length of a bankruptcy proceeding is measured in years, not months or weeks, as in the US. Moreover, in most of continental Europe a person can be discharged of his or her debt only after a lengthy period, often five to seven years, during which time almost all income must be devoted to debt service. In the US, by contrast, the corresponding period lasts less than one year in most cases. Moreover, the terms of discharge tend to be much stricter in Europe. An extreme case is Spain, where mortgage debt is never extinguished, not even after a personal bankruptcy. This key difference between the US and (continental) Europe explains the resilience of the US economy to the collapse of its credit boom. The excessive debt accumulated by households has been worked off much more rapidly; and, once losses have been recognized, people can start again. The cause of the transatlantic growth gap should not be sought in excessive eurozone austerity or the excessive prudence of the European Central Bank. There are structural reasons for the eurozone economy’s slow recovery from the financial meltdown in its periphery. Most importantly, compared with the US, the excess debt created during the boom years has been much more difficult to work off. European officials are right to promote structural reforms of EU countries’ labour and product markets. But they should also focus on overhauling and accelerating bankruptcy procedures, so that losses can be recognized more quickly and over-indebted households can start afresh, rather than being shackled for years.

The 23 year old joined Chelsea from PSV Eindoven in 2007 but failed to ever make an impact on the first team. The Dutch left back was also a part of many loan deals, to clubs including Coventry City and Newcastle United. However, van Aanholt has finally completed a permanent move away from the Bridge by signing a four year deal at Sunderland, with the fee of the transfer yet unknown. Sunderland survived relegation last season and are clearly looking to improve, with a deal reportedly agreed with Liverpool for Fabio Borini, but with the deal yet to be completed. And after 5 relatively unsuccessful years at Stamford Bridge, but while still establishing himself as a solid young defender, Sunderland can add van Aanholt to their books at The Stadium of Light. His departure was all but certain when Chelsea opted to splash out on left-back Filipe Luis to replace Ashley Cole instead of looking to their academy for potential long-term alternatives. Chelsea said on their official website: We would like to thank Patrick for his service and wish him the best of luck for the future. 72 Views Written by Billy Writer and occasional editor for the Chelsea News App and Site team.

The following detailed map shows you all the places you can and cannot fly a drone. Video drones are awesome. From shooting incredible nature footage to superhero spoofs , drones can create some spectacular videos. So it’s no surprise that the market is flooded with new drone models coming out all the time. As drones get cheaper we can expect to see more and more flying through the skies. However, concerns surrounding drone safety have begun to find their way into pop culture. For example, a runner at the Geraldton Endure Batavia triathlon in western Australia received injuries after allegedly being struck with a drone . In Ohio a man faces felony charges after refusing to down his drone so a medical helicopter could land. Even the name “drone” implies scary robot overlords or unmanned death planes. With all the negative press surrounding drones, it’s no surprise that there has been stricter regulations in regard to drone piloting. As of June 21, 2014 national parks have been designated “no drone” zones along with airspace surrounding airports. 11 states have already passed drone regulatory legislation with many more to come, so figuring out where you can and cannot fly a drone can be really quite confusing. Luckily for us the good people at The Verge have created an interactive showing us where drones are prohibited. This map only takes into account “no fly zones” surrounding national parks, military bases, and airports. Before you fly a drone for your next big project you need to make sure your state allows for commercial drone use. This map was created by The Verge . Thanks for sharing guys!

But having a Thermomix makes the task so much easier – all you need is a few simple ideas up your sleeve.     One of the best lunchbox solutions is a nutritious spread that you can store in the fridge and then popped into a sandwich when you’re in a hurry. One of my family’s favourites is Cannellini bean and tuna puree [ p151 Thermomix Cooking for Your Baby & Toddler ] or a delicious hummus [ p152 ] (if you’re at a nut-free school, omit the tahini). Adding beetroot or broccoli to your hummus is a wonderfully healthy variation – just steam it first in your Varoma and you can whizz it straight through. If these flavours are new to your child, adding a known favourite, like cheddar cheese, to their sandwich can sometimes help overcome any suspicions.   Steamed sweet potato or pumpkin, soft enough to spread straight onto bread with some mayonnaise and tuna or cheese and avocado, is another sandwich idea. And if you’re looking to boost the nutritional value of just about any sandwich, a little sprinkling of chia seeds is a great option, as is LSA [ p143 ] (although it’s not suitable for nut-free schools).   If you want a break from sandwiches, try a tomato and zucchini bake [ p154 ] or my Carrot, potato and zucchini fingers [ p112 ]. You can freeze it in slices and just grab one as you go, or even bake it in a muffin tin for individual serves. Meatballs are another great option [ p157 ], as are C heesy vegetable muffins [ p175 ] and Multicoloured hash browns [p146] .   Apricot and coconut balls [ p166 ] are also a lunchbox winner because you can make them days before and they travel so well. They’re wonderfully nutritious and you can add some extra variety by switching the apricots for dried figs or other dried fruit. If you’re school is nut free, omit the almonds and use some extra wheat germ and coconut instead (coconut is ok under many schools’ policies but double-check yours to be sure).   I hope these tips make your mornings a little bit easier when trying to get the kids out the door on time.

We chatted with the super nice, super talented actor about the changes of that happening,  Step Up ‘s fifth installment, what it was like to bring back so many old characters this time, and which celebrity he’d want to have a real-life dance battle with. We think you’ll be very happy with his answer to that question—and thrilled to know that Ryan’s not ruling out a role in the Magic Mike sequel! Read on for all the juicy scoop… OK ! Exclusive: Ryan Guzman Dishes on His Romantic Scenes With Jennifer Lopez OKMagazine.com: Because you’re in LA and Vegas for this movie, did you have to up the choregraphy and production this time around? Ryan Guzman: It’s always kind of a “how do we outdo ourselves this time.” You never want to show the same move more than once and become super redundant. But dance is always evolving so there’s so much you can pull from and so many new things you can do. But yeah, we created a bigger set, we created more intense dance scenes and I wouldn’t say that we were trying to outdo ourselves as far as make everything better, but make it new and exciting and I think we accomplished that and in turn made it better. OK ! News: Meet Ryan Seacrest’s Super Hot New Girlfriend OKMagazine.com: This movie brings back many old characters from the first few films. Was it weird working with everyone again? RG: It was definitely eye-opening when I first heard about it. It’s like the Fast and Furious version of Step Up , bringing all the characters back. I was wondering how we were going to do that so that the audience isn’t going to be like, “wait a second, that doesn’t make sense to me.” But we found that way and it all happened super natural in how we create this new crew with all the characters from previous movies, and it became really fun to play against them all again. It was cool to just have a reunion for Step Up . Whichever character you liked, we have! Except Channing. We didn’t bring you Chan (laughs). OKMagazine.com: In this film your character Sean struggles once he gets to LA in paying rent and stuff. Was it similar for you when you were starting out? RG: Yeah, its definitely a relateable story. When I came out to LA I had maybe 27 dollars to my name. I was living in a one bedroom with five guys and I was driving a mini van for god’s sakes (laughs). So it was a struggle to figure out, did I make the right decision? What am I going to do with nothing out here? And I think with this movie we’re trying to show aspiring dancers that it takes hard work and determination. WATCH: Sneak Peek of Melissa Rycroft on Season 9 of Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders OKMagazine.com: Is there a song or artist you want to dance to in a Step Up film but haven’t gotten the chance to yet? RG: Yeah I would love to do some Justin Timberlake or Michael Jackson or even James Brown. Yeah, do something like, funk music or something. Justin Timberlake’s not technically funk, but… OKMagazine.com: Who’d win in a dance battle between you and JT? RG: Laughs. JT dances a lot more than me so I think it’d be a good match. I’d have to train for that one for sure but I’ll give it to JT for now. PHOTOS: 13 Movie and TV Moments You Can’t Miss at Comic-Con OKMagazine.com: Which celebrity is your dream dance battle partner? RG : I’ve never thought about that. Good question. You know what, just because I know everybody’s always been talking about it since Step Up Revolution , Channing [Tatum.] I met him when we were filming Step Up All In  and he’s a great guy and I’m sure we’d have a good time battling each other (laughs). Maybe in Magic Mike … OKMagazine.com: Oh, you’d be amazing in Magic Mike . Call him up! RG : Oh no, no no no. (Laughs). PHOTOS: 13 Pics of Channing Tatum Being Ridiculously Hot OKMagazine.com: We spoke to you late last year and your New Year’s resolution was to find a girlfriend and that seems to have happened for you… RG: Yes, I do have a girlfriend and I am very happy (laughs). Editor’s Note: Ryan is dating Melanie Iglesias from MTV’s Girl Code! Aren’t they cute?! OKMagazine.com: So, what’s on your to do list for the rest of the year? Try to get an audition for Magic Mike 2 ?! RG: I think my resume for Magic Mike 2 is already in there so if Channing wants to use me, I’m sure I can pull some kind of move from Step Up Revolution or Step Up All In  (Laughs). PHOTOS: 29 Sexy Photos of Celebs in the Bath Step Up All In is in theaters now, and keep a lookout for Ryan who’s starring with Jennifer Lopez in Boy Next Door , out in 2015!

U.S. intelligence officials told media outlets that Russia “created the conditions” for the incident by arming and training fighters in eastern Ukraine. “I don’t know what was in their minds. I assume, or at least I’d like to assume, they thought it was a Ukrainian military airline,” Clinton said. “But they were equipped by the Russians, they were trained by the Russians, there may have even been Russians on the ground with them. And the result was this horrible attack.” President Obama has been critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin in the wake of the crash, saying that he’s “directly responsible” for ensuring that the separatists cooperate with the investigation into the incident. Ramos asked Clinton, a potential presidential candidate, whether the American stance toward Putin has been too weak and if she bears any responsibility for the current state of affairs in Ukraine as the U.S.'s former top diplomat. “No I don’t,” she said. Clinton defended the Obama administration’s effort to “reset” relations with Russia in 2009, saying that it led to the renewal of a key nuclear arms treaty and international sanctions against Iran. “We did a reset and we got something for it,” she said. Clinton said she warned in 2011, when Putin announced he would seek a return to the presidency, that he could cause instability in Europe. “I warned everybody, I sent a memo to the president, I sent another memo on my way out, that I believed Putin was coming back in a much more aggressive way,” she said. Even taking into account Putin's hostility toward the West, Clinton said that “we could not have predicted at that time the steps he would take to annex and occupy part of another country,” referring to his military intervention in Crimea. “The underlying mentality of Vladimir Putin is very aggressive, and he is trying to control his borders. So the general view of him is not surprising,” she added. “The specifics and his willingness to arm these insurgents and enable them to do things like shoot down the Malaysian airline — I think that has been somewhat surprising.” Clinton also pinned blame on former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who caved to Russian pressure against aligning with the European Union. That decision triggered massive street protests in the capital of Kiev, which turned violent. “Yanukovych should not have been such a coward, but he turned out to be one,” she said. It’s unfair, however, to blame the tensions in Eastern Europe on any one individual, Clinton said. “I don’t think it’s anybody’s fault,” she said. “We would love to have Russia be a modern nation and a real democracy. Unfortunately, that’s not Putin’s vision and that’s what he is acting out right now.” Don't miss out on any of Fusion's highlights -- get Fusion today.

To unlock this special geocaching achievement, you’ll need to find 6 specific geocache types in the month of August. Here are 7 tips to help you achieve, well, Achiever status: 1. Be Prepared This motto is not just for the Boy Scouts. Finding 6 different geocache types requires planning ahead, especially if you live in Traditional-heavy area. Check to see what souvenirs might require leaving your neighborhood, and see if you can tie them into a weekend road trip or business travel. And, of course, always carry your tools of the trade (TOTT) in case opportunity strikes. (Never, never get caught without a pen!) 2. Start Early With only 6 geocache finds needed to earn the Achiever souvenir, it can be tempting to put them off until the last weekend. Warning: This is not college. Cramming is no longer a safe bet. Start knocking off the souvenirs early in the month to allow room for error. 3.  Partner with Friends Feeling intimidated by finding a new geocache type? That’s what friends are for! As we learned with the Geocaching Personality Quiz , it takes all kinds to make up the geocaching community. Find someone who has a different personality type than you so that you can each specialize in finding specific geocache types. Friends can even help you sprinkle extra awesome on the 7 Souvenirs of August . 4. Throw a Party To earn the Socializer souvenir, you need to log an Attended at an Event Cache, Mega-Event, or Giga-Event. Sign up for the Weekly Newsletter to learn about upcoming events in your area, or host one yourself ! Remember, hosts can log an Attended for their own Event Caches. 5. Host a CITO Don’t have an Earth Cache near you? No problem! Every neighborhood could use a CITO event . You’ll earn the Nature Lover souvenir and Mother Earth will thank you. 6. Double Check Your Neighborhood We’ve all done it. You’ve cleared out all the Traditional geocaches in your area, and you feel like there’s nothing left to find. (Okay, you Puzzlers and Collectors. Some of us have done this. Okay, fine. I can only say with certainty that I’ve done this. Happy?) This is your chance to take off your Traditional geocache blinders and see the Multi-Caches, Mystery Caches, and Letterbox Hybrids for what they are: geocaches waiting for your autograph. 7. Put it in Perspective Yes, earning the Achiever souvenir can be daunting. But let’s put the challenge in perspective: Traditionals are easy to come by, you can attend or host an event, and if there’s not an Earth Cache in your area, you can host a CITO event. Knock those three out and you’re already halfway there!

Lovell claims that a neighbor, Dale Taylor, shot the boxer in Lovell’s yard when the canine was tied to his lead. Taylor claims in court papers that he shot AJ when the dog got into his chickens. Protecting livestock is lawful in the State of Tennessee. AJ was alive when he was brought to veterinarian Chris Lewis, but he succumbed that night to his injuries Taylor and his wife, Kathy Taylor, filed for an order of protection, writing in the court papers that they felt threatened by Lovell and his brother, Dan “TreBob” Lovell, who is also a neighbor. This comes to General Sessions Court on Aug. 5. Stewart County Sheriff’s Deputy Chip Warden, who was investigating the case, said there was not sufficient evidence to charge Taylor in the case. He spoke with the district attorney, who told him that Lovell is welcome to appear before the grand jury on his own. Lovell filed a criminal summons against Taylor, which means that Taylor has 10 days in which to be booked, but not incarcerated, at the jail. This will then be heard in General Sessions Court on Aug. 5, and the judge will determine whether or not they will proceed with the case. According to the court papers, Taylor admitted there has been friction with Lovell in the past, and Lovell agreed to that assessment when interviewed. Since it is an ongoing case, Deputy Warden cannot give any more specific information nor can he provide the police report of the incident. Taylor said he prefers not to discuss it at this time. And the chicken is roughed up but still alive. The aftermath While the incident works its way through the judicial system, all parties still have to carry on. While the Taylors appear to be living in fear of reprisal, Lovell is simply bereft. AJ had been with him for 11 years. “This just isn’t fair, especially when it helps someone get through a situation,” said Dan Lovell. “It might just be a dog to someone else, but it’s not to Cathead. That dog has kept his feet on the ground. He has heart problems and complications from exposure to Agent Orange…that dog kept him focused.” AJ was well-known in the community. He was a dog who loved to play with children and was gentle to even the smallest ones. Lovell would take him to Camp Rainbow at Brandon Springs, a camp for children with illnesses that would usually preclude their attendance at any summer camp. The children loved AJ. As with all service dogs, he was in tune with his owner, frequently accompanying him into town. Since Aug. 17, hand-crafted memorials, flowers and food keep showing up at Wayne Lovell’s house. A handmade sympathy card from a Sunday School class is adorned on the front with a drawing of a cat’s head, and on the inside, there is scripture and personal messages, including, “I am sorry for your loss.” Bonnie Lill, 931-232-5421 Reporter, The Stewart Houston Times blill@gannett.com", "score"=>159.22993, "summaryTitle"=>"Service dog shot in Indian Mound area", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Community outpouring provides solace for owner", "cities"=>["us-tn", "us-ky"], "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.theleafchronicle.com/story/news/local/stewart-houston/news/2014/07/25/service-dog-shot-indian-mound-area/13180805/", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1nDCntq", "lastseen"=>"20140726004346", "page"=>"http://www.theleafchronicle.com/story/news/local/stewart-houston/news/2014/07/25/service-dog-shot-indian-mound-area/13180805/", "ogtitle"=>"Service dog shot in Indian Mound area"}, {"domain"=>"greenedgecycling.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406304789000", "site"=>"www.greenedgecycling.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726002055", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406334055553", "title"=>"ORICA GreenEDGE Cycling Australia : News : Meier and Albasini top finishers on stage 19", "initial"=>"20140725161309", "summaryText"=>"Christian Meier and Michael Albasini were ORICA-GreenEDGE’s best-placed riders on stage 19, crossing the finish line in 39th and 44th position respectively.

Hoping to contest what looked likely to be a reduced sprint, a crash in the final three kilometres held up such ambitions as Navardauskas took out a solo victory . “The boys were in a good position, but got held up behind the crash,” sport director Matt White said. “It’s obviously disappointing after the guys put Albasini in a good position, he has been solid in contesting these reduced sprints during the Tour, but that’s racing.” A breakaway of five men took off in the early stages of the day but were never allowed more than a few minutes by a peloton insistent on pulling it back together for a bunch sprint. When lone rider Ramunas Navardauskas counterpunched on the only classified climb of the day with 12km to go, the chase was on in the closing kilometers.   Wet roads and a technical finale made for a dangerous run in, a large crash amongst the reduced peloton within the final 3km diminishing much of the chase. Navardauskas held on to win by seven seconds. Attention now turns to the penultimate day of the 2014 Tour de France, a 54km individual time trial and one of the main goals of specialists Luke Durbridge and Svein Tuft. “We will go out and see the course in the morning,” White said of tomorrow’s challenge. “It is not as easy as the profile may look, it’s a very long time trial even for Tour de France standards and it is not flat. “Both the boys are definitely capable of running top ten and if they have a really good day they could finish in the top five as well.  Tony Martin will obviously go into the stage as the overwhelming favourite.”", "score"=>159.19289, "summaryTitle"=>"Meier and Albasini top finishers on stage 19", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"ORICA GreenEDGE Cycling Australia : News : Meier and Albasini top finishers on stage 19.

One of the victims came forward recently to the Archdiocese to report the abuse. She said the incidents occurred in the 1980s at then-Archbishop Keough High, an all-girls school that became Seton Keough after a merger with Seton High in 1987. Helene Murtha, 58, admitted to having a “series of sexual encounters” with three former students. “The Archdiocese immediately reported the allegation to the appropriate civil authorities and will continue to cooperate fully with any investigation(s),” according to the release. Murtha told the Archdiocese that the incidents occurred at her home, at the high school and at the Monsignor O’Dwyer Retreat House in Sparks, Maryland. Murtha taught at Archbishop Keough from 1977 to 1992 and again in 2010 and 2011 as a substitute teacher and a full-time member of the school’s Campus Ministry Team, according to the release. Prior to her return to the high school, Murtha served as the Associate Dean of Student Life at the then-College of Notre Dame of Maryland. Murtha also periodically worked in the Archdiocese’s Division of Youth and Young Adult Ministry, serving in a number of positions related to youth retreats and other programs, the release states.   “The Archdiocese of Baltimore is committed to protecting children and helping to heal victims of abuse,” according to the release. “We urge anyone who has any knowledge of any child sexual abuse to come forward, and to report it immediately to civil authorities.

Profile Recent Articles 20 favourite party foods of all time 20 old-fashioned winter desserts to make you glad it’s cold! 21 ways to winter-proof your beauty routine We’ve all had that unpleasant moment of opening up our winter electricity bill and reeling in horror. But without knowing it, you could be paying far more for your heating costs than you need to. Try these 12 simple tricks to warm your home and stay toasty all winter long. 1. Shut out the cold Keep doors closed to unused rooms. This doesn’t just stop cold air from moving into the rest of the house – it helps contain the heat you’ve generated in the room that you are heating. 2. Reverse your fans How cool is this? (Or rather, how hot?) Reset your ceiling fans to turn clockwise in the winter. Turn them on at a low speed and you’ll drive warm air downwards. 3. Oven lovin’ Leave the oven open after you bake. Simple, yet brilliant. (But of course be cautious if you have little ones about.) 4. Open shut them, open shut them Open curtains and blinds during the day to let the sun in, then close them as soon as the sun goes down to keep out the cold. Little thing, big difference. 5. Get snakey Block drafts with weather stripping, rolled up towels or homemade draft stoppers. That little door snake is worth its weight in gold, my friends. 6. Change your sheets Well, hopefully you’re doing that regularly anyway, but if you swap cotton for flannel sheets and throw on a down comforter and some extra blankets, you’ll have a much toastier bed. 7. Move your furniture Sitting by the window can cause radiant heat loss from your body to the glass, so ensure your furniture is not against a large window or pushed up against an outside wall. Also, avoid placing large pieces of furniture such as couches in front of radiators as they will absorb all the heat. 8. Heat thyself It’s winter, folks, so get into the spirit of things by snuggling up with a soft woollen jumper, thick socks and a blankie. Drink a nice steaming hot cuppa while you’re at it. Heating yourself will make you feel all warm and cosy without having to resort to the heater’s highest setting. 9. Foil it Putting aluminium foil behind the radiators in your home will reflect the heat back into the room rather than allowing it to escape through the walls. Tricky, huh? 10. Don’t exhaust your possibilities Exhaust fans in the kitchen and bathroom simply suck all the hot air that rises to the ceiling out of your house. No! Come back, hot air! Turn them on only when necessary and shut them off again quick smart when done. In the case of the bathroom, the steamy air after your shower will make your house feel warmer too, so enjoy it, don’t destroy it. 11. Go old school Remember hot water bottles? They were fun. And hey, they still work. As do little heat packs that you can warm up in the microwave. If you don’t have either of those, simply blowing a hair dryer over your sheets before getting in can take away that teeth-rattling chill. 12. Rug up On your floor, that is. Area rugs do more than just add colour and style – they keep your room cosy, too. Floors can account for as much as 10 percent of heat loss if they’re not insulated and a nice rug or mat will prevent cool air from entering the room and stop your toes going numb.

I rarely find it more fun than solving problems on the fly, or with premeditated strategy. There are a few special games, though, that loop past that criticism, wind through furious delirium, and land among my favorites. Super Meat Boy is one, Hotline Miami is another, and Lovely Planet now joins them. It’s not quite of the same caliber, but it’s fantastic. Lovely Planet is first-person shooter—it’s played from a first-person perspective, and you shoot things—but shares few traits with other modern shooters. It includes 80 levels (unless there are more I somehow haven't unlocked), and they're all beaten in under a minute. Beating them, however, can take 10 or more tries—let’s say, 100 or so more tries. The number of failed attempts isn’t recorded, sadly, but I clocked about seven hours just getting to the final area. Gotta go fast Your ‘gun’ (a stick, really) fires an infinite supply of purple cubes that fly in slow, straight lines. Shooting accuracy is less important than I’d like—bullets don’t retain your momentum and there are generous hitboxes around the stationary ‘baddies’—but combined with its high-speed platforming, Lovely Planet is a brutal test of precision. There’s only one way to survive its obstacle courses: restart over and over until you've memorized every flick of your wrist from the level start to the purple pole at the end. It’s built for speedrunners who will exploit every bit of code to shave milliseconds off their runs, but just finishing a level is an accomplishment. Here are a few reasons you might die or otherwise fail: You were hit by a projectile. You were hit by a homing projectile (you must shoot them out of the air). You jumped too soon. You jumped too late. You shot a neutral character. You didn’t shoot a baddie (you must shoot all of them to complete a level). You shot and destroyed a platform you need to jump on. You let an apple touch the ground (they’re fired into the air like skeet disks, and must be shot down). You touched a red blob on the ground. You turned left when you should have turned right. The five areas gently introduce new concepts, then escalate to challenges I sometimes thought were mistakes. There is no damn way it is seriously asking me to hit a damn jump pad, spin around, shoot a damn apple, turn back, shoot the damn blob on the next platform, and nail the next damn jump. And then, through brute force repetition, I do it. I learn the first jump—using Lovely Planet’s total air control to strafe and spin mid-leap—and then I can repeat it, and then I move on to the next problem. Later, I’ll bound across jump pads blasting three or four projectiles out of the air in milliseconds, feeling roughly like I’ve cracked the Matrix. The mechanics are all so simple that I can practically see the code as a homing cube closes in on me, languidly halving its distance, and then again until it smacks into my face. The enemies always behave the same and the physics never surprises me, and that predictability makes Lovely Planet solvable by bashing my head against it until conscious thought is replaced with pure eye-hand mastery. Shapeland Beating a level in that autonomic trance feels amazing, and I even enjoyed the cruelest stages, sore wrists and all. My glowing praise for Lovely Planet only dims for its presentation. I had few technical problems outside of occasional frame dropping in windowed mode, and that it refused to save my resolution setting, but I never fell in love with Lovely Planet’s lovely planet. I don’t mind that it rejects newfangled things like ‘lighting’ and ‘textures’—visual simplicity is an asset where precision jumping is required—and I don’t mind how cheerful and cute it is. I’ve cried out for more Nintendo-style whimsy on PC in the past, but unlike a Nintendo game, there’s no clever, coherent world building. Lovely Planet’s areas are only differentiated by minor additions to the motif—the swamp is shrouded in fog, for instance—and they’re weird, but forgettable. There’s some attempt at narrative in mysteriously silent cutscenes, but I couldn’t follow them. It’s more abstract than 30 Flights of Loving, and not as appealing as its Katamari Damacy inspiration. The sound design is another sore spot. The ‘pshew pshews’ of my bullets and lazy groans of dying baddies lack vitality, and the latter are sometimes so drowned out by the music that they’re not useful indicators that my shot hit. Eventually, I turned off the music. Each area has a single looping theme song, and while the third area’s chipper beat grew on me, the first’s aggressively happy tune did not. Lovely Planet’s awkward keyboard-navigated menu is its worst quality, along with its limited and poor presentation of information. At the end of a level, sometimes I get stars. I don’t know what the stars mean. Sometimes I set a WR, which I’ve determined stands for ‘world record.’ I’m glad my MLG pro skills are being recorded, but there’s no name attached to record times and no leaderboard otherwise. I can’t compare my times to my Steam friends’, or see how I rank except against the one world record. At least I know I’m the best—as long as you ignore that any records I set were in an early copy, against almost no other players. I’m sure they’ll be crushed as soon as Lovely Planet releases, but I love how beating a level makes me feel like I’ve tapped into some impossible agility, like a seasoned t'ai chi master demonstrating his superhuman mind and body control. Lovely Planet expects things of me that initially seem absurd. Then, by the end of a level, it’s hard to remember why I thought any of it was hard in the first place. Its rapid repetition training can be grueling, but learning, succeeding, then mastering its trick jumps and perfect projectile slinging is heavenly.

The Mariners reacquired Morales on Thursday in a trade with the Twins (AP Photo/Ann Heisenfelt) SEATTLE — Did Kendrys Morales’ return to the Mariners make you go, “What?” He knows how you feel. “It caught me by surprise,” Morales admitted prior to batting cleanup Friday as the Mariners’ designated hitter against the Baltimore Orioles at Safeco Field. “But I feel good to be back here and be with the teammates I had a year ago…It sort of came together quickly. It’s just a surprise, but I’m glad to be here.” The Mariners reacquired Morales, 31, in a Thursday trade from Minnesota for minor-league reliever Stephen Pryor. The move came after numerous failed attempts last year to prevent Morales from becoming a free agent. Those efforts included the Mariners extending a qualifying offer of $14.1 million after the season, which meant any club that signed Morales would also be required to surrender a high draft choice as compensation. That qualifying offer hampered Morales’ effort to get what he considered an acceptable deal on the free-agent market. That compensation provision no longer applied after the June draft. Not coincidentally, Morales reached an agreement shortly thereafter with the Twins for roughly $7.4 million through the end of the season. The trade puts the Mariners on the hook for about $4.33 million. Morales will be an unencumbered free agent after the season because the rules prohibit the Mariners from making a qualifying effort under his current circumstances. For his part, Morales has no regrets in how his situation unfolded. “I made the decision last year to be a 100-percent free agent,” he insisted. “I don’t feel bad about the decision.” For now, though, Morales says his goal is “to focus on what’s ahead and helping this new team win and qualify for the playoffs.” Morales batted .234 in 39 games with the Twins with 11 doubles, one homer and 18 RBIs. His on-base percentage was just .259, while his slugging percentage was .325. The Mariners are hoping Morales’ six-plus weeks in Minnesota effectively served as a spring training, and that his production will approach his career norms over the season’s final 10 weeks. “I just want him to be a stabilizer, drive in runs and have good at-bats,” manager Lloyd McClendon said. “Productive at-bats. He’s certainly capable of doing that. “I can tell you this, he’s not going to be overwhelmed by any situation. He’ll be a nice piece to add to our lineup.” Morales also believes he’s ready to break out. “It definitely feels that way,” he said. “I’m getting a lot of at-bats under my belt, and I’ve been playing better lately and swinging the bat with a little more authority.”    Montero to Tacoma First baseman Jesus Montero was optioned back to Triple-A Tacoma in a corresponding roster move to accommodate Morales’ arrival from the Twins. Montero was hitless in three at-bats Thursday after being recalled earlier in the day to serve, effectively, as a space-holder for Morales.   Miller/Taylor decision Shortstop Brad Miller returned to the lineup Friday when the Mariners faced a right-hander in Baltimore’s Kevin Gausman. That put Chris Taylor on the bench after going 1-for-3 on Thursday in his big-league debut. McClendon said the two will continue to share duty at short while serving as backups to second baseman Robinson Cano and third baseman Kyle Seager while utilityman Willie Bloomquist recovers from a bruised knee. But McClendon says Miller and Taylor won’t be a strict left/right platoon. “I’ll look at match-ups,” McClendon said, “and see who best fits that particular night and put them in there.”   Lineup juggling Seager dropped from fourth to fifth in the lineup when McClendon opted to insert Morales as the cleanup hitter behind Cano. Seager might also see time as the No. 2 hitter in future games. “I’ve played with the idea of Seager hitting second,” McClendon acknowledged, “because he’s such a good fastball hitter. That is definitely a possibility.” What won’t happen is Cano shifting to No. 2. McClendon dismisses a growing belief among some in the game that a lineup’s best hitter should bat second. “I think three hole is the best place for your (best) hitter,” McClendon said. “Hopefully, you’ve got two guys in front of him who are capable of getting on base. “Hopefully, a lot of times, he’s coming up when (runners are on) s first and second or first and third.”   Short hops Felix Hernandez entered Friday’s game with 999 1/3 career innings at Safeco Field. The only active pitcher with more innings at one ballpark is Toronto lefty Mark Buehrle , who has 1,306 2/3 innings at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago. Buehrle pitched 12 seasons for the White Sox… James Jones got his 20th steal in Thursday’s loss. He is the fourth rookie in club history with 20 steals. The others are Ichiro Suzuki (56 in 2001), Phil Bradley (21 in 1984) and Donell Nixon (21 in 1987)…The Mariners suffered their 12th shutout in Thursday’s 4-0 loss to the Orioles. That matches Tampa Bay for the most shutouts among American League teams.   Minor details Hi-A High Desert outfielder Gabby Guerrero was picked as Baseball America’s Prospect Hitter of the Day for Thursday after going 3-for-4 with two homers in a 10-8 victory at Rancho Cucamonga (Dodgers). Guerrero, 20, recently played in the All-Star Futures Game. He is batting 19-for-44 (.432) in his last 10 games and is batting .312 overall with 12 homers and 69 RBIs in 95 games.   Looking back It was 34 years ago Saturday — July 26, 1980 — that Mariners struck for three runs in the second inning at Toronto and snapped Dave Stieb’s streak of 23 consecutive innings. Stieb’s streak ended when Julio Cruz drew a two-out walk with the bases loaded. The Mariners went on to win 7-2 in the first game of a doubleheader at Exhibition Stadium. Toronto then gained a split with a 7-5 victory. Worth noting: The opener was played in 2 hours, 16 minutes; the second game in 2:20.   On tap The Mariners and Orioles continue their four-game weekend series at 1:10 p.m. Saturday at Safeco Field. Right-hander Chris Young (8-6 with a 3.22 ERA) will face Baltimore righty Bud Norris (8-6, 3.78). Root Sports will broadcast the game. The series concludes at 1:10 p.m. Sunday. The Mariners have an open date Monday before departing on a six-game trip to Cleveland and Baltimore.  ", "score"=>159.05138, "summaryTitle"=>"Mariners notebook: Morales admits he’s surprised to be back", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>"us-wa", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://blog.thenewstribune.com/mariners/2014/07/25/mariners-notebook-morales-admits-hes-surprised-to-be-back/", "referrer"=>["thenewstribune.com", "go.com", "t.co", "direct", "bleacherreport.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/WHAt1D", "lastseen"=>"20140726004721", "page"=>"http://blog.thenewstribune.com/mariners/2014/07/25/mariners-notebook-morales-admits-hes-surprised-to-be-back/", "ogtitle"=>"Mariners notebook: Morales admits he&#8217;s surprised to be back - Mariners Insider"}, {"domain"=>"scientificamerican.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406300768000", "h3"=>["Subscription Center", "Comments", "More from Scientific American", "Latest News", "Most Read", "Fact or Fiction?: The Sixth Mass Extinction Can Be Stopped", "Plastics Change Color—and Back—in Less Than 1 Second", "Abrupt Climate Shifts in the Past Offer Warning for Future", "What Processes in the Brain Allow you to Remember Dreams?", "250-Year-Old Eyewitness Accounts of Icier Arctic Attest to Loss of Sea Ice", "Let’s Stop Pretending the Death Penalty Is a Medical Procedure [Editorial] - Scientific American", "Think Twice: How the Gut's \"Second Brain\" Influences Mood and Well-Being - Scientific American", "Strange but True: Drinking Too Much Water Can Kill - Scientific American", "Agriculture's Sustainable Future: Breeding Better Crops - Scientific American", "Do we really use only 10 percent of our brains? - Scientific American", "Follow Us:", "Scientific American Contributors", "Solve Innovation Challenges", "Latest from SA Blog Network", "News From Our Partners", "Science Jobs of the Week", "Get Total Access to our Digital Anthology", "Email this Article"], "site"=>"www.scientificamerican.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726000908", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406333348279", "title"=>"Fact or Fiction?: The Sixth Mass Extinction Can Be Stopped - Scientific American", "initial"=>"20140725150608", "summaryText"=>"Is the planet undergoing the sixth mass extinction in its history courtesy of the human species?

Jul 25, 2014 By David Biello SIXTH EXTINCTION: Humans have killed off at least 322 animal species, including tortoises (and dodos) on the islands of Mauritius. But imported tortoises from the Seychelles, like this one, may be able to fill that loss. Nik Cole / Science The most famous mass extinction came from space , but the biggest might have been because of carbon dioxide. Cataclysms, whether the asteroid that ended the dinosaurs’ reign or volcanism that may have caused the Great Dying , drove the first five mass extinctions in Earth’s history, in which 75 percent of more of the planet’s life died out. The sixth mass extinction may now be beginning—and the apocalypse this time is us.   During the last several centuries we have burned through eons worth of fossilized sunshine, changing the climate for our fellow species. We use more than half of the planet’s unfrozen land for cities, logging or food, eliminating the habitats of our fellow animals and plants. Before we even achieved civilization, we had already helped hunt the biggest, fiercest animals—woolly mammoths, giant kangaroos and giant sloths—to extinction.   Biologists and paleoecologists estimate that humans have driven roughly 1,000 species extinct in our 200,000 years on the planet. Since 1500 we have killed off at least 322 types of animals , including the passenger pigeon, the Tasmanian tiger and, most recently, the baiji , a freshwater dolphin in China. Another 20,000 or more species are now threatened with extinction according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature , which keeps a list of all the known endangered plants and animals on the planet. The population of any given animal among the five million or so species on the planet is, on average, 28 percent smaller, thanks to humans. And as many as one third of all animals are either threatened or endangered, a new study in Science finds .   In the jargon it's an \" Anthropocene defaunation ,\" or sixth mass extinction, and one caused by humans. Scientists can't be sure of the current die-off rate, perhaps because much of it is happening to beetles and other insects that are notoriously overlooked. But according to that new study in Science , the total number of such invertebrates fell by half over the past 35 years while the human population doubled. Other recent studies suggest that the current extinction rate is roughly 1,000 times faster than the average pace in Earth's history. That makes this the fastest extinction event on record, even if it is not yet a mass die-off.   The biggest, fiercest animals still left on the planet—elephants, tigers, whales, among others—are most at risk. And we humans have shown no inclination to stop the activities —overexploitation for food, habitat destruction and others—that drive extinction.   And yet it's not too late. In the past few decades humans brought the black-footed ferret back from just seven individuals; vaccinated and hand-reared condors to relative abundance; and battled to preserve and restore populations of hellbender salamanders, to name just a few in just North America alone. According to another new analysis in Science , people have physically moved 424 species of plants and animals to protect them from extinction.   For such assisted migration efforts to succeed, careful attention must be paid both to genetics and habitat. There is no point in bringing back the baiji, for example, if the Yangtze River remains polluted and overfished. But conservation efforts can work. Fishes can rebound when fishing pressure is removed, just as Maine haddock and Washington State coho salmon both have. The reforesting of the U.S. eastern seaboard shows that when farms go away, woodlands return, and coyotes, deer, turkey and other wildlife move back in. The animals and plants of the Amazon rainforest have benefited from Brazil's efforts to curb deforestation. And in what might prove an enduring lesson in conservation, paleoecologists have shown that 20 out of 21 large mammals in India —from leopards to muntjac deer—have survived there for the past 100,000 years alongside one of the largest human populations on the planet.   To avoid the sixth mass extinction we will probably employ more aggressive conservation, such as moving species to help them cope with a changing climate. Think re-wilding: reintroducing species like wolves or beavers that were once present in a given ecosystem but have since disappeared. Aggressive conservation might also mean killing off newcomer species to preserve or make room for local flora and fauna; in New Zealand, rat extirpations have helped kakapos survive.   In the most extreme case aggressive conservation could involve bringing in new animals to fill the role of animals that have gone extinct. For example, European sailors ate their way through the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius, killing off the dodo and the local tortoise species. But closely related tortoises from the neighboring Seychelles archipelago have been imported recently , and they have helped restore the island ecosystem, including bringing back the endangered local ebony trees. As a result of that success, similar projects are being considered from Caribbean islands to Madagascar. There is even some hope of bringing back entirely extinct species in the future using the new tools of synthetic biology.

If the gravitational pull of a black-hole is so powerful that even light cannot escape, then how is it possible that mass is not destroyed? Where does it go? One current theory tries to explain this using the concept of “information” . As matter is pulled into the black hole, the information that makes up its volume is encoded on the surface of the black hole. Think of this like a vegetable juicer. As vegetables enter the juicer as whole pieces of biologic information, they are pulped into liquid form. From this point on, it would be impossible to ever recreate the solid vegetable from the juice. The holographic universe principle  suggests that the code within the volume of the solid carrot would me microscopically encoded onto the lid of the juicer as a set of 1s and 0s. In a black hole, information is spread onto the surface so thinly that it gives the impression that mass has actually been destroyed. Essentially, the mass is converted into information which is then represented on the surface area of the black hole. Now think about this. All the mass that goes into a black hole is 3D. Yet, all the information is on a surface AREA (2D) . It shows that to describe mass, we only need information about its 2D structure. 3D information isn’t needed at all. Think of it this way. If you look at a credit card, some of them have “3D holograms” (the “scratchy” surfaces that give a 3D illusion) . It’s essentially a 2D surface area that looks 3D because of the way the light bounces off of it. Now let’s apply this to our own lives. The holographic theory states that our own lives might just be a 3D “hologram” that’s being reflected off of a 2 dimensional surface . Here’s an analogy. The universe is a credit card that contains information (about everything) on its surface. We are essentially the projected 3D hologram. The surface that we are reflected from is the cosmological horizon (the farthest point we can theoretically “see”) – 13.75 billion light-years away (the farthest possible distance anything can be, given the age of the universe) . How can we say this? Well we can see from black holes that 3D information isn’t necessary to describe an object. Thus, it’s not a fundamental property. Obviously, we’ve never found any evidence that solidly supports the holographic universe principle, but researchers have discovered several things that indicate they’re on the right track. Namely, astronomers discovered a weird, high frequency noise coming from GEO600: an Earth-based   gravitational wave   detector. The team leader  — Craig Hogan, a physicist at Fermilab Center for Particle Astrophysics — believes that this find could be  attributed to some type of a holographic noise , but that remains highly controversial at the current moment. TL;DR:  You are a being that is actually 13.75 billion light-years away from where you think you are. Plus, the entire 3D world is just an illusion – everything exists on a 2D surface. Enjoy this?

However, the muscle-car-styling just isn't right for some buyers that need four doors and proper rear seats to haul around the family. It appears that Dodge has their backs, though, because the Hellcat is very likely on its way into the Charger in the near future. Imagine the looks on your passengers' faces when you stomp down on the throttle. According to Road and Track , when Dodge submitted the Hellcat for engine power certification to the Society of Automotive Engineers, the company included the Charger on the paperwork . That showed that the automaker wanted the engine checked out for the sedan, too. R&T reckons the 707-hp Charger would hit the road about a year from now, clearing the Challenger for a year of exclusivity with the powerplant. When the Charger SRT Hellcat does hit the road, it may carry a very special accolade. Assuming nothing beats it in the meantime, it might be the world's highest horsepower production sedan. Think on that for a second. Even a Mercedes S65 AMG only has 621 horsepower , though a good bit more torque at 738 pound-feet to the Dodge's 650 lb-ft. So while the beastly engine is getting put into other models, where else would you like to see it? The Ram? Grand Cherokee?

The retired mental health nurse, who cannot be named, told the jury of four men and eight women at Gloucester Crown Court that the alleged victim got on very well with patients and staff and was \"a delightful girl.\" She told the court via video link: \"I was a sort-of unofficial mother figure for the student nurses and they would come and confide in me. \"One day I noticed that, while working on a ward, she looked very upset so I took her aside. \"She was very distressed but after some time she told me what had happened. She said she had been sexually abused from the age of five or six until the age of 15 or 16\" Earlier, a former neighbour of the alleged victim took the witness stand. He said, in response to questions from prosecuting barrister Rosemary Collins: \"She (the alleged victim) was my girlfriend for a couple of years but after we first had sex she broke down and told me about the abuse. \"She said that her abuser used to blindfold her. \"After our relationship ended some time later she told me that she had a relationship with a much older doctor but she couldn’t have sex with him because it reminded her of the defendant.\" Later, in a police interview read out in court, Benfield said \"I am devastated. There must be a lot of hate for me. None of this is true.\" On the first day of the trial the court heard that Benfield would tie the girl’s limbs to the four corners of a bed to carry out his depraved acts. He used table knives and forks to penetrate the girl from the age of five and started raping her when she was ten, it was alleged. The offences against the girl started in 1970 and went on until 1981, the court heard. Benfield also denies cruelty towards a boy who had once allegedly witnessed him in the act of sexually assaulting the girl. Benfield is alleged to have picked on the boy and subjected him to physical abuse from that time on. Ms Collins said that when Benfield was arrested he denied all the allegations.

While it seems that Banana Republic no longer has the line featured on its website, the collection of looks displayed on Monday were replete with perfectly tailored chinos, exposed ankles, and  crisp, chambray button-downs. While it’s understandable that Banana Republic created such a “look” (you know, as an attempt to stay in touch with a generation that’s moving away from more traditional industries), responses from the startup community were mixed, with the majority of my own network brushing it off as a laughable offense to the low-pressure, chill, dress “code” for which the sector has become renowned. When you look around the room at startup events, hackathons, or even just your everyday coworking space, you’re more likely to find men (and women) wearing t-shirts (often of some startup or featuring geeky references) and a pair of jeans or shorts. Sure – a good 20(ish) percent of the room take their time to actually dress up in a button-down tucked into jeans or even sport the occasional suit or blazer, but even in those situations, they’ve probably only done so because they have to meet with a new, potential investor or the like. To show what it’s really like to work at a startup, we reached out to guys from several different startups and asked them to share with us descriptions of their own personal styles. We also asked them to show us pictures of what they’re wearing. Check out what the following 41 startup guys have to say about their “startup style” and see what they actually wear on their day-to-day: “I would have to say that my personal style is ‘comfortable business’ attire. I often go to entrepreneur or start-up events here in Kansas City and I try to look professional but not overdone. One consideration is that since I never know when I’m going to meet a new prospect or client I need to be looking as professional as possible most of the time, especially since I’m involved in money management. At the start-up events I often wear my suit however I sometimes wear comfortable polos or t-shirts with silly slogans like ‘What I really need are minions’ – LOL. It just depends on my mood and/or the venue, however comfortable with a professional look is the name of the game.” – Mathew Dahlberg, Founder of 111th Street Investments “My style is casual chic, I prefer designer sneakers, jeans and t-shirts. I’m stylish and fashion-forward but still pretty relaxed. The way I dress for the office is the same as when I’m out with my wife or kids.” – Mark Ghermezian, CEO and Cofounder of Appboy “I have a casual style and usually like to wear dress or polo shirts with bright colors or comfortable cotton shirts, denim jeans and brown shoes. I often stand while working, so I spend extra on my shoes for comfort, typically splurging on Santoni dress and casual shoes. Occasionally, I like to wear cowboy boots when working in hometown Austin.” – Brian Magierski, President and COO of Appconomy “When meeting with florists, the guys wear nice jeans or nice pants with a button-down, sometimes adding a light sweater. When attending more corporate functions…they will get a bit more dressed up – a nice suit and stylish tie always does the trick.” – Brittany Sykes on their cofounders at BloomNation “This might sound very geeky but nothing makes me happier than going back to my basketball days and wearing sweats with my sandals and socks. However now since I have to look (and act) grown up at times, you can usually catch me walking around in the same khaki shorts if it’s summer or blue jeans if it’s winter. I like to think I fool everyone by switching out the shirts I wear. You’ll rarely catch me in a suit, regardless of who I’m meeting.” – Shazhil (Shaz) Amin, Founder of Blue Track Media Describing his style as “CTOoooh My!” and citing Marc Andreessen, Prince circa 1987, Grumpy Cat, and George Takei as style icons: “To me, fashion is about scalable code, service-oriented architecture, and chic accessories.” – Gabriel Flateman, CTO and Cofounder of Casper “My style is crisp yet casual. I often am sitting down with our clients, and end the day with a press interview or a speaking engagement, so some level of presentability is called for. I like the mix of light and dark colors, of simple and complex patterns (ask me about my chalkstripe linen blazer with the paisley lining, custom of course). I’ve never really subscribed to the hoodie and flip flop look, not because there’s anything wrong with it, but because its just not what I look like. I think our clothes and our style are the first piece of ourselves that speak to the world — so I like to make mine sing.” – Vik Venkatraman, Cofounder of Clothes Horse “I actually have been an entrepreneur involved in two startups over the last seven years. I rarely wear a tie, and I’m actually wearing a baseball cap half the time…I literally showed up like this to work today. Yesterday I was wearing a button up with a vest and pocket square…” – Emmanuel Lay, Cofounder and CEO Fashion Stork INC   “My whole life is an intelligent pursuit of my dreams and happiness, so I tend to wear what makes me happy. From the inside out I’ve dedicated my life to a strong body, spirit, and mind and my clothes demonstrate that. As we inspire others with why we’re doing this; what we do proves what we believe. My slim, tailor[ed] fit shirt shows my fitness, while my vest and tie display my professionalism. I am bringing a valuable service to the masses that only speaks [to] the truth of what’s best and disregards all else. So I don’t wear products in my hair and keep a beard for a genuine, uninfluenced appearance. My jeans fit properly and are clean to show I take pride in finding the right fit and again showing off why I never miss legs day in the gym. And lastly my shoes, my grandfather taught me a lot of meaningful things, similar to never eating at a restaurant with a dirty bathroom… never trust a business man with dirty shoes. That is my style, a representation of everything that I am in one wardrobe. To show who I am and what I believe, for there are leaders and those that lead, I dress to lead.” – Scott Young, Founder and President at Love Gifted “I would say, I have a unabashedly prep style. It’s a look that dates back to gentlemen during the early 1900′s. Over the years, I’ve built a wardrobe of a select set of items that I will wear for the rest of my life. I don’t follow any new trends, I strictly stick to one look.” – Obi Onyejekwe, Creative Director and Cofounder of Nito “It all starts with a tee, preferably crazy (teddy bears, violence, check). Adding jeans or bright colored pants to make sure people are turning their heads your way. Spicing up with matching sexy sneakers (bloody red, check) – and I’m set.” – Sasha Kovaliov, Marketing at PandaDoc “For me it’s all about comfort and versatility. In sales you have to feel good about yourself 100% of the time, whether you’re pitching on the phone or in-person. Also, never underestimate a good thinking cap (credit Goorin). #OaklandSmart.” – Josh Gillespie, Sales at PandaDoc “I’m absolutely killing it in gym shorts and an Under Armour T-shirt – standard Casual Tuesday attire (same as Casual Monday and Casual Wednesday to Friday). It’s good to be the boss!” – Yarin Kessler, Founder and CEO of PDF Buddy “A while back I probably did dress to impress, but since bootstrapping my startup, I’ve been focused on comfort which probably includes wearing t-shirts and to dress up my polo. I’m currently working on Phroogal in NJ and with the humid weather you’ll see me wearing sneakers, shorts and a shirt. If I were to describe my style – ‘casual minimalist.’ Some of my friends describe me as ‘frugal chic’ to coincide with my startup…It’s more about comfort and ease without worrying about food or drinks dirtying my clothes which is bound to happen when I’m eating while in front of my computer. I’ve lost many a t-shirts because of pizza stains.” – Jason Vitug, Founder and CEO at Phroogal “My daily style is almost always a dark denim jean, leather belt, and a standard slightly v-necked shirt, or short-sleeved collared shirt of various colors. I usually wear a dark blazer jacket on top. It would be hard to find me without a pair of Lucchese boots- always brown or black.” – Steve Papermaser, Chairman and CEO of Powershift Group “[Chris] told me that he essentially only dresses up on days when he has meeting and that even on those days. Since LA is pretty casual, he generally does not have to stray too far from his normal attire. Living pretty much beachside in sunny Santa Monica, his normal day-to-day attire is a tee (normally his company tee with logo), shorts (or jeans if its chilly day), “flops” aka flip flops and a trucker hat usually a fellow Silicon Beach startup swag item…And lastly, let’s not forget the beard! After all, what busy startup founder has the time each morning to shave!” – Priscilla Vento describing her friend Chris Brereton, the CEO of PwrdBy “I typically submit my proposals via video and I wear casual clothes, sometimes t-shirts. It takes away from the typical business, corporate structure while giving the proposals a personal feel. I went into a meeting last week in NYC wearing a nice solid color t-shirt, jeans and Converse sneakers. Thankfully I closed the deal. Even my professional head shots has me wearing comfortable clothes…If I’m not comfortable during my meetings, my business will suffer. When I am not recording a video or going into a meeting, shorts or sweatpants is my normal day-to-day wear.” – Jason Berkowitz, SEO Expert and Head of Operations at SEO Services New York “Start-up guys are hipsters, complete with skinny jean cut-offs and a ‘stache. Here’s what one of our guys looked like at our Fourth of July company potluck.” – Stephanie Yang describing her colleagues at Spendgo “The guys here like to wear print shirts with witty childhood images on it, some like to dress more rugged, some dress trendy.” – Alexis Valerio describing her colleagues at Sqor “Tagboard men’s style is dominated by denim, earth tones, and tees. It’s smart, comfortable, and minimal, though extra points are given for Star Wars flair.” – Sean Sperte, Chief Product Officer at Tagboard “My personal style is laid back and professional. Professionalism is my top priority when it comes to style, but I like to put my own twist on it to keep it interesting and forward thinking.” – Justin Rezvani, Founder and CEO of theAmplify “I wear a navy suit, white shirt, red tie and brown shoes every day. It is my signature look every where I go. I make too many important decisions all day that I do not want to waste time figuring out what to wear. I did not always dress like Mr. Professional. I started my first business out of my college dorm room, DJ Connection, growing it to 4,000 events per year before I sold it. It wasn’t until my mentor, Clifton Taulbert, pointed out that looking like Eminem when I met with mother’s of the bride was not helping grow my business. As soon as I started wearing my navy suit, white shirt and red tie every single day, my business took off and I became SBA Entrepreneur of the Year.” – Clay Clark, CEO of Thrive15 “At UrbanBound, we are less about the details and more about FUN-ctionality. Our friend Mike over here on the right is never seen without his MacBook Pro. It’s really more of an accessory than anything else – sort of like the way girls wear bracelets. Tom, pictured in the middle, represents one of the best ways to get ahead in the startup world: wearing whatever your boss wears. He actually pays the doorman to snap a pic of the CEO, pictured left, walking out of the building so he can replicate his outfit every morning. But in the end, the most important factor in picking out your startup outfit is whether you can go out drinking in it after work.” – UrbanBound Team “I like to dress comfortably, yet semi-professionally for work. I would call it ‘dressy-start-up with a splash of Texas.’ Always wear a collared shirt – often a solid or plaid button down – that I like to tuck in. Usually, you’ll catch me in a shirt from one of my favorite menswear designers, Jeremy Argyle. I usually either wear jeans or slacks, but if it’s hot enough, I might be tempted to wear dress shorts.” – Joshua Ernst, Cofounder and CEO of urBin Storage “Our young team is known in the building and around our city of London, Ontario, Canada, as some of the best-dressed young professionals. Our male employees, in particular, are the epitome of ‘start-up style’ with their Sperrys, Clarks, and immaculate Converse sneakers, ‘skinny’ trousers and bermuda shorts – in a plethora of pleasing neturals – topped with the classic checkered dress shirt, artfully tucked in under an understated, elegant belt. There is the occasional cap placed carefully over a pomaded haircut, as well. It is a twist of West Coast cool with East Coast edge, with a bit of Canadiana street style thrown in. The stylish, city-dwelling men of our startup have a professional eye-catching look that is also practical for everyday responsibilities in the Google-esque, “living office” space of Voices.com. The roles of these well-dressed employees range from Account Managers to Business Development Managers, to Export Managers and our VP of Sales and our CEO, himself, David Ciccarelli.” – Voices.com team About the Author Ronald Barba Ronald Barba is a staff writer and the East Coast reporter for Tech Cocktail.

Attaochu grabbed back. For about 10 seconds, the two Chargers linebackers jostled, arms extended, hands locked on the other's shoulder. They twisted and turned like antlered animals in a turf war before Johnson paused the drill. He gave Attaochu tips on technique. The rookie nodded. They raised arms and began again. This offseason, the Chargers felt whatever outside linebacker they drafted in May would step into an ideal situation, positioned behind Johnson, a 12th-year veteran, and Dwight Freeney, in year 13. It's happening. Johnson gave the second-round pick a private lesson after the first practice of training camp, a mentorship he and Freeney plan to continue to provide this year. Thursday's lesson was taking on a run block. Johnson watched Attaochu engage a tight end in practice. The technique needed refinement. \"He came up to me after the play, and I told him, 'Hey, let's meet up and talk about it after practice,' \" Attaochu said. \"He came and found me, and we just went through it. ... With that type of experience, you know he's seen a lot. He's telling me what the tight end is going to do. To get that type of wisdom, it's priceless. It helps leaps and bounds to get that type of teaching from a player.\" Attaochu is 6-foot-3 and 252 pounds. The Chargers clocked the 10-yard split in his 40-yard dash at 1.55 seconds. That time distanced himself from other prospects at the position, a hair faster than the 1.56 Jadeveon Clowney, the No. 1 overall pick, registered at the NFL Scouting Combine. The 21-year-old has the physicals tools. Mentally, he has the access to learn to use them. \"What Jerry brings to the table is stuff you can't teach,\" Johnson said. \"If he learns the stuff you can teach, you've got a freakin' player. You can't teach me to run faster. You can't teach me to get more flexible. But that stuff for him is just natural. If he learns that other stuff, you've got a baller.\" Attaochu so far has received more on-field pointers from Johnson than Freeney. That largely is because, this spring, Freeney wasn't on the field. Recovery from a torn quad tendon last September held him out of team drills. He is back at practice now, cautiously optimistic about a leg he says feels \"great.\" He plans to watch the rookie and share knowledge when applicable. Four years ago, at a golf tournament, all-time NFL sacks leader Bruce Smith made himself available to Freeney in a similar capacity. Freeney, 34, has 108 career sacks. Johnson, 32, brings a different expertise, specializing in the run game. They're the only Chargers defenders 30 or older. Johnson turns 33 on Aug. 14. \"You're not going to find too many places where you've got guys in place that are actually contributing to the team with that experience,\" Freeney said. \"Bruce Smith told me, 'All that experience isn't for you to hold onto. It's for you to share. Help the younger generation. Help the game. Share a little bit to make their time in their league a great experience.' That's what we'll do. 'Whenever I get a chance to pull Jerry aside, I will. We're all in it together.

Brynne Frost, CEO and owner, along with Ana Reilly, principal and owner believe every employee has the responsibility to help one another. “The culture provides the setting for each person to thrive and most importantly, when you work at DCi you know that each of your co-workers, no matter what position or department, has your back and is quick to lend a hand.” When working in the event business, teamwork is essential for turning a hotel ballroom into a Bollywood spectacular.   American Specialty Health As an independent and privately owned specialty health services company, American Specialty Health knows how to treat its 1,200 employees well.  The company culture focuses on employee health and well-being with Healthyroads Coaching, health education classes, a fitness center, and standing desks.

The Multicultural Development Program coaches employees to become future leaders and the Bridging the Gap Program is a mentoring program for underrepresented part-time employees. President and CEO, Baron Herdelin-Doherty prides himself on hiring people with multicultural backgrounds and giving them the opportunity to reach and achieve their professional goals.   Underground Elephant For CEO Jason Kulpa, emphasizing “culture over profit” is what it’s all about. He believes that promoting good values and having the office feel like family is most important. The enterprise marketing software solutions company offers an inspiring workforce culture—one where employees don’t just show up to work but they excel in their careers. One way Underground Elephant achieves this inspired culture is through weekly training meetings with retired boxer, Paul Vaden. Vaden doesn’t have marketing experience, but he talks to employees about setting goals, achieving them, and becoming a champion. Also, employees participate in quarterly community service events that are held during the workday allowing employees a chance to get out of the office. Continued learning is another aspect of the company culture with quarterly training and employee development programs.   MI Technologies As an e-commerce company, MI Technologies focuses on everything from logistics to web analysis.

Contributing:", "content"=>"This installment of the Prospect Hot Sheet covers games from July 18-24. Remember, this feature simply recognizes the hottest prospects in the minors during the past week—it’s not a re-ranking of the Baseball America Top 100 Prospects . Contributing: Ben Badler, J.J. Cooper, Matt Eddy, Vince Lara-Cinisomo and Josh Norris. 1. Tyler Glasnow , rhp, Pirates Team : high Class A Bradenton (Florida State) Age : 20 Why He’s Here : 1-0, 0.00, 6 IP, 4 H, 0 R, 11 SO, 2 BB The Scoop : After recovering from an early-season back injury that might have hampered his command, Glasnow has dominated high Class A batters. He struck out 11 in one start this week, and two of his last three starts have featured double-digit strikeouts. His 97 punchouts ranks fourth in the Florida State League despite not getting into a game until three weeks into the season. 2. Bubba Starling , of, Royals Team : high Class A Wilmington (Carolina) Age : 21 Why He’s Here: .524/.583/.810 (11-for-21), 6 R, 1 2B, 1 3B, 1 HR, 5 RBIs, 3 BB, 4 SO, 2-for-2 SB The Scoop : Starling hit .127 in April and pretty much erased any good memories of a strong finish at low Class A Lexington last summer. Here we are in July and once again, he’s starting to put things together. Starling is hitting .319/.358/.458 this month while cutting his strikeout rate to reasonable levels (though he still ranks second in the Carolina League with 112). He still has problems squaring up the ball to let his natural power play, but he clearly doesn’t need to get sized for shoulder pads yet. 3. Archie Bradley , rhp, Diamondbacks Team : Double-A Mobile (Southern) Age : 21 Why He’s Here : 0-0, 2.57, 7 IP, 3 H, 2 R, 10 SO, 1 BB The Scoop : Five starts at Triple-A Reno, two months on the shelf with an elbow injury, followed by a return to the Southern League, where he spent most of 2013. That’s not how the Diamondbacks would have charted Bradley’s development course for this season, but with pitching prospects, the best-laid plans often go awry. The preseason No. 9 prospect in the game has steadily increased his pitch counts into the 90s in five starts at Mobile, but he has struggled to finish hitters and limit free passes. That changed this week, when Bradley fanned 10 Chattanooga batters while walking only one. 4. Joc Pederson , cf, Dodgers Team : Triple-A Albuquerque (Pacific Coast) Age : 22 Why He’s Here : .318/.516/.864 (7-for-22), 7 R, 4 HR, 10 RBIs, 7 BB, 5 SO, 2-for-3 SB The Scoop : As great as Pederson’s power potential is, it’s his defense that may finally get him out of Albuquerque and into the big league lineup. The Dodgers’ five-headed outfield doesn’t have a true center fielder, a problem a Pederson promotion would quickly fix, as he’s a tick-above average defender in center with an above-average arm. And he’d provide plenty of power to go with his still frightening strikeout rate. 5. Aristides Aquino , rf, Reds Team : Rookie-level Billings (Pioneer) Age : 20 Why He’s Here: .444/.500/.963 (12-for-27), 9 R, 2 2B, 4 HR, 13 RBIs, 2 BB, 6 SO, 3-for-4 SB The Scoop : Aquino was the star of extended spring training for the Reds in 2013 as he put on power displays in empty Cactus League parks. It’s one of those honors that goes unnoticed because the stats don’t count. And when the stats did begin counting, Aquino was overmatched at Billings after a solid start in the Rookie-level Arizona League. His return trip to the Pioneer League is going much more smoothly, as his nine home runs are second in the league. Aquino has legit power potential and a mature approach to his craft. 6. A.J. Cole , rhp, Nationals Team : Triple-A Syracuse (International) Age : 22 Why He’s Here : 2-0, 1.29, 14 IP, 11 H, 2 R, 0 BB, 12 SO The Scoop : Cole’s bread-and-butter pitch is his fastball, a lively offering that sits in the low- to mid-90s. He’s used that fastball with tremendous success this season, earning a promotion to Syracuse a month ago. Since then, Cole has a 24/3 SO/BB mark in 31 innings in the International League and hasn’t walked anyone in his last three starts. 7. Alex Meyer , rhp, Twins Team : Triple-A Rochester (International) Age : 24 Why He’s Here : 0-0, 0.75 ERA, 12 IP, 8 H, 1 R, 12 SO, 4 BB The Scoop : Even without their two top prospects, the Twins have seen plenty to be encouraged by this season. Along with righties Jose Berrios and Kohl Stewart, Meyer is leading the march into the future. He twice pitched brilliantly this week, and showcased a fastball up to 98 mph as well as his typically wicked breaking ball. He’s throwing his changeup more often now, as well. After a string of three straight starts with four walks each, he was walk-free in his last turn for the second time this season. 8. Trea Turner , ss, Padres Team : low Class A Fort Wayne (Midwest) Age : 20 Why He’s Here : .500/.560/591 (11-for-22), 4 R, 2 2B, 3 RBIs, 3 BB, 2 SO, 3-for-3 SB The Scoop : This marks the second Hot Sheet appearance in a row for the former North Carolina State all-American, who is hitting .450/.511/.600 in 10 games at low Class A since a bump from short-season ball. Scouts point to a long swing as a reason to temper enthusiasm about a quick start, not to mention the obvious small sample size. His speed, never in question, has played nicely as he’s stolen 14 of 15 bases. 9. Joey Gallo , 3b, Rangers Team : Double-A Frisco (Rangers) Age : 20 Why He’s Here : .345/.406/.690 (10-for-29), 4 R, 1 2B, 3 HR, 11 RBIs, 3 BB, 13 SO The Scoop : After ceding the home run crown to fellow Las Vegas-bred slugger Kris Bryant for a few days, Gallo got hot again and re-took the lead. He’s gone deep in three of his last four games, and he has a total of 34 for the season. That’s in 96 games. So he’s averaging a longball about once every three games. He’s got five more homers than Jose Abreu, the major league leader. 10. Justin Chigbogu , 1b, Dodgers Team : Rookie-level Ogden (Pioneer) Age : 19 Why He’s Here : .393/.393/1.071 (11-for-28), 9 R, 1 2B, 6 HR, 11 RBI, 0 BB, 6 SO The Scoop : The former high school defensive end had scouts agape about his massive raw power and that has started to play in games this season. The 6-foot-2 lefty masher cracked six homers in the past week, including three in a game on July 18. He was not a big swing-and-miss guy in high school, but he seems to have sold out for power as a pro as he has struck out 50 times in 132 at-bats. 11. Dilson Herrera , 2b, Mets Team : Double-A Binghamton (Eastern) Age : 20 Why He’s Here : .444/.500/.778 (12-for-27), 4 R, 2 2B, 2 3B, 1 HR, 5 RBIs, 2 BB, 5 SO, 3-for-3 SB The Scoop : Ever since the Pirates signed Herrera out of Colombia in 2010, he has been a natural at the plate. With Neil Walker entrenched at second in Pittsburgh and Alen Hanson ahead of Herrera on the depth chart, the Pirates were willing to include Herrera in the trade last August to acquire Marlon Byrd . Now, Herrera is having a breakout season. With easy hitting rhythm and bat-to-ball skills, he has been on fire since his promotion to the Eastern League last month, hitting .357/.420/.563 in 31 games. 12. Greg Bird , 1b, Yankees Team : high Class A Tampa (Florida State) Age : 21 Why He’s Here: .435/.533/.826 (10-for-23), 6 R, 3 2B, 2 HR, 8 RBIs, 6 BB, 4 SO The Scoop : Back problems cost Bird the first month of the season, but he’s back to hitting now that he’s returned. As a first base-only prospect, he’s going to have to mash, and mash he did this week. He swatted two longballs, and one more just a day before this Hot Sheet period began. Bird walked more than 100 times last year, and his walk rate this season (13 percent) is among the top five in the Florida State League. 13. Sebastian Elizalde , rf, Reds Team : high Class A Bakersfield (California) Age : 22 Why He’s Here: .429/.458/.905 (9-for-21), 7 R, 1 2B, 3 HR, 9 RBIs, 2 BB, 3 SO, 4-for-5 SB The Scoop : Signed out of the Mexican League at age 21, the lefty-hitting Elizalde has legitimate on-base skills (.419 OBP this season) and good speed (17 steals), but he’s coming off a homestand at hitter-friendly Bakersfield, so the three-homer week could be an aberration. He’s more than just a curiosity, though, after hitting .310 this season and drawing 55 walks in 87 games. In The Team Photo Tyler Austin , rf, Yankees . A bright future seemed a distinct possibility following an eye-opening 2012, but Austin has spent 2014 trying to rebuild his prospect stock after a wrist injury ruined 2013. He’s made strides, especially in the past week at Double-A Trenton. He’s gone 12-for-29 (.414) and most importantly to the Yankees, he’s hitting for extra-base power with four doubles and two homers. The Yankees clearly have a need for an outfielder with righthanded power, and perhaps Austin is working his way back on the radar. Javier Baez , 2b/ss, Cubs : The Cubs’ decision to add Manny Ramirez to Triple-A Iowa as a player/coach appears to be paying off. Since Ramirez arrived, Baez is hitting .310 and is showing much more consistency. Before Manny, Baez had 10 three-strikeout games. With Manny, he has none. He’s hitting .299/.356/.623 with 13 extra-base hits in 20 games this month. Aaron Blair , rhp, Diamondbacks . The 2013 supplemental first-rounder from Marshall turned in one of his finest starts of the season in his Double-A Mobile debut on Monday. Blair struck out nine batters in 6 2/3 innings while allowing four hits, no runs and no walks. The 22-year-old has 134 strikeouts on the season, ranking him second in the minors, one behind Southern League-mate Ben Lively of the Reds, who also is a fast-rising college righty from last year’s draft. Adam Engel , cf, White Sox : It’s hard to not be immediately drawn to Engel’s premium speed and athleticism, but the offensive performance has always lagged behind. That wasn’t the case this week, when the 22-year-old went 11-for-21 (.458) with two homers, a triple and two doubles at low Class A Kannapolis. Gabby Guerrero , rf, Mariners . The Futures Gamer went 12-for-28 (.429) at high Class A High Desert this week, slamming two homers and three doubles while knocking in five runs. Guerrero’s extra-base hit output has ticked upward since the California League all-star break, while his strikeout rate has held steady. Likewise, the 20-year-old’s power production is virtually the same both home and away from High Desert’s hitter’s paradise. In other words, he’s making real progress. Nathan Karns , rhp, Rays : The 26-year-old had a legit shot to win a spot in the Tampa Bay rotation out of spring training. He failed in that quest, and instead was optioned to Triple-A Durham, where he’s struggled with command. Not so this week, however. He spun his first walk-free start this week, opposite fellow Hot Sheeter Alex Meyer, showing off command of his low- to mid-90s heater and power breaking ball. He’s allowed three earned runs or fewer and walked two or fewer in five of his last six turns. Lucas Sims , rhp, Braves: It hasn’t been a bad season for Sims, but the Braves certainly expected more from their preseason No. 1 prospect, who has a 4.60 ERA at high Class A Lynchburg and a strikeout rate that dropped from 10.3 per nine innings in 2013 to 6.0 this season. More starts like his last one—seven innings with one (unearned) run and nine strikeouts—would be encouraging to see. Not-So Hot Austin Hedges , c, Padres. The Double-A San Antonio backstop went 1-for-18 (.056) with a triple, seven strikeouts and three RBIs this week. After a reasonable first half (.700 OPS), the 21-year-old Hedges’ production has spiraled downward in the second half, to the point where in 28 games he’s batting .206/.241/.245 (.486 OPS). He can redeem his season with a strong finish, but for now the Padres’ top prospect is off-kilter at the plate. Adam Plutko , rhp, Indians : When a command artist with average stuff can’t find the strike zone, this is what happens. He got just two outs in his most recent start at high Class A Carolina, and one of those came courtesy of a sacrifice bunt before it became obvious that he was basically throwing batting practice. Two of the nine hitters who faced him went deep, and he was yanked after Wilmington had batted around. Trevor Story , ss, Rockies . Story received the bump to Double-A Tulsa after tearing up the California League, but has had a rough time of it against better competition. In the past week he went just 3-for-25 (.120) with 16 strikeouts. Story might not be a shortstop because he lacks the range, but he has righthanded power and the versatility to fill a super-utility role if it comes to that. Andrew Velazquez , ss, Diamondbacks : Talk about falling off a cliff. After ending an on-base streak that lasted more than 70 games, the Diamondbacks’ sleeper prospect has endured a ghastly week. He went 1-for-21 (.048) with nine strikeouts and no walks at low Class A South Bend and was caught stealing in his only attempt. Blip aside, evaluators like his potential going forth both offensively and with the glove. Helium Watch Ozhaino Albies , ss, Braves: When teams scouted Albies early on in 2012, he was a slightly built 5-foot-7, 133-pound shortstop who showed good wheels and strong baseball instincts. Size was an obvious concern, and while he showed ability to hit in games from both sides of the plate, he had little experience facing good velocity or pro-caliber pitching in Curacao. By the time the Braves signed him for $350,000 on July 2 last year, he had grown to 5-foot-9, 150 pounds, showing 70 speed on the 20-80 scale and a strong arm. Not only did the Braves surprise people by skipping Albies over the Dominican Summer League, but they were so impressed with his dominance of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League that he’s already earned a promotion to Danville in the Rookie-level Appalachian League. A line-drive hitter with a good eye and bat control, Albies hit .381/.481/.429 with 11 walks and six strikeouts in 19 GCL games. The only tool the 17-year-old doesn’t have is power, but his combination of explosive tools, hitting acumen and on-base skills makes him on of the fastest-rising prospects in the organization.  ", "score"=>158.59564, "summaryTitle"=>"Prospect Hot Sheet (July 25): Glasnow Retains Top Spot", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"The Prospect Hot Sheet features Pirates righthander Tyler Glasnow reprising his role as No. 1.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.baseballamerica.com/minors/prospect-hot-sheet-july-25-glasnow-retains-top-spot/", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "bleacherreport.com", "t.co", "direct", "chicagonow.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/WQrhYB", "lastseen"=>"20140726004428", "page"=>"http://www.baseballamerica.com/minors/prospect-hot-sheet-july-25-glasnow-retains-top-spot/", "ogtitle"=>"Prospect Hot Sheet (July 25): Glasnow Retains Top Spot - BaseballAmerica.com"}, {"domain"=>"abs-cbnnews.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406300292000", "h2"=>"abscbn2010 Shows TV Patrol Lates/Most Discussed", "h3"=>"Suspek sa pagpatay sa isang Viva Hot Babe, huli", "site"=>"www.abs-cbnnews.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004414", "keywords"=>"PNP, murder, Biyernes, tv patrol, most wanted, gus abelgas, Hulyo 25, 2014, Viva Hot Babe", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335454297", "title"=>"Suspect in Viva Hot Babe slay falls | ABS-CBN News", "initial"=>"20140725145812", "summaryText"=>"Suspek sa pagpatay sa isang Viva Hot Babe, huli Arestado ng Mandaluyong police ang isa sa \"most wanted\" list ng PNP at sinasabing isa sa mga suspek sa pagpatay sa miyembro ng Viva Hot Babe.

It's a sort of benign tumour,\" Dr Dhiware told the BBC. \"At first, we couldn't cut it out so we had to use the basic chisel and hammer to take it out.\" Dr. Dhiware says once the opened it, little-pearl-like teeth starting coming out. In total: 232 teeth.

In high school, I used to pluck out my own eyelashes. That’s how bad I was at dealing with stress. People would be like, “Oh Andrea why don’t you have eyelashes?” And I would be like, “BECAUSE THEY GIVE ME ALLERGIES!” I took my social studies final with a wet paper towel over my eye because I was convinced it would block out any allergens. That’s where I was in my life at that time. I had no idea how to cope with stress, so I just developed really unhealthy habits. Everyone knows that they should deal with stress, but knowing what you should do and actually doing it, are two very different things. What is stress, really? The  National Institute of Mental Health  defines stress as: “The brain’s response to any demand. Many things can trigger this response, including change. Changes can be positive or negative, as well as real or perceived.” It’s probably more aptly put to say that stress is the body’s response to any demand. Your response to stress is the same despite whether or not the stress is all in your imagination. The American Psychological Association conducts an  annual  stress survey each year to which they almost always find that surprise, surprise, everyone is really stressed the hell out. 43 percent of American adults lie awake each night because of stress 35 percent of American teens lie awake each night because of stress 71 percent of people say their stress is caused of money (surprise, surprise) Let’s break this down further into the  three  categories of stress: Acute:  This is the most common form of stress, which people easily recognize. This kind of stress is short-term and stems from demands or pressure we feel from the recent past or near future. This kind of stress, however, can be exciting like playing in a soccer tournament. Episodic Acute:  This kind of stress occurs most often in people who overextend themselves on a consistent basis. They live from crisis to crisis. They are usually in a rush and almost always trying to play catch up. Chronic:  This form of stress comes from traumatic experiences that are difficult for the individual to escape. People who experience chronic stress often take it on as part of their own identity and find it difficult to escape. This kind of stress is the most dangerous for our body and mind. What happens inside your body when you are experiencing a stressful event? Well, it all begins right here in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland: This happens very, very quickly. Your body responds to a stressor before your eyes can even finish processing what is in your visual field. A  single neuron  in the prefrontal cortex can respond to a stressor in .12 seconds. To contrast that, it takes your brain .15 seconds to  process an image . Once your body has sent a distress signal your Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) kicks in—aka—the  fight-or-flight  response. This triggers a response in your adrenal glands (which sit right on top of your kidneys). Initially, your adrenals pump stress hormones like epinephrine (adrenaline), into your body, which causes your body to undergo  certain changes : increase in heart rate and blood pressure open up bronchioles to allow for my oxygen to circulate to the brain glucose and fat deposits are burned off to provide your body with energy other bodily systems are suppressed (like the urge to go pee) to ensure all energy is directed towards what your body believes is a pressing danger It takes far less time for your body to respond to a threat than it does for your body to come down from it. The Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) is responsible for  applying  the brakes once a threat or danger has subsided. Adrenaline isn’t the only hormone to be released during a stressful event though, there’s also cortisol. When stress gets out of hand Cortisol is regulated in the body by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA is the  second  component of our stress response system. Cortisol is used to help bring us back to  homeostasis  after a stressful event by managing our metabolic response. Cortisol production can get out of hand and when this occurs, some not so excellent things can happen: Can cause a disruption to the  circadian rhythm , or your sleep/wake cycle, due to hormones being released at the wrong time of day. Weakens and depresses the immune system by ‘aging’ immune cells. That’s why chronically stressed individuals experience problems with  fighting . Can overwhelm the hippocampus (learning and memory center) and cause it to shrink. This makes it difficult to form new memories or recall old ones. The more cortisol your body produces, the more  difficult  it is for your body to gain control over cortisol production. Can also shrink  neurons  in the brains Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) which is responsible for problem-solving, adaptation, and emotional regulation. This doesn’t begin to scratch the surface, there’s stress induced: anxiety disorders,  mood disorders ,  heart disease … a veritable cornucopia of  health issues  caused by stress. Now that I’ve successfully increased everyone’s stress level, let’s figure out how to prevent is from destroying us? Talk with other stressed out people You might think this would go against logic, but alas, you would be wrong. It’s the double negative effect of stress (that’s not actually a thing, I just made that up). Sharing your feelings with someone who is in a similar emotional state with you helps to buffer some of those stressed out feelings you have.  Researchers  found that individuals who shared similar stressors had reduced levels of cortisol in their system after sharing their feelings and emotional state. Practice self-affirmation Chronic stress makes it difficult for us to solve problems and hampers our creativity. Researchers at  Carnegie Mellon University  found that just writing some self-affirmations you can help offset the negative effects of chronic stress. By  affirming  some of your personal values you can lower your cortisol levels. Self-affirmation helps to stabilize our sense of self—whereas stress can represent a threat to the self. We can reinvest our  positive self-resources  (self-esteem) to help us mitigate the psychological and physical damage stress causes. Laugh Really, this seems obvious? But even the  anticipation of laughter  can help reduce your stress levels. When we expect a positive event, like laughter, three levels of stress hormones are reduced. Researchers  found that when we anticipate laughter our stress hormones reduce by a pretty significant amount. The study participants cortisol levels decreased by 39 percent and epinephrine by as much as 70 percent. “Our findings lead us to believe that by seeking out positive experiences that make us laugh we can do a lot with our physiology to stay well.” This is perfect—especially for me—as I laugh at my own jokes 100 percent of the time. Though I’m not sure that counts. Hug it out You know how at the end of every Full-House episode there was usually a hug? Well, Danny Tanner and co. may have had the right idea. Hugs help to  reduce  cardiovascular stress, improve our immune system, and encourages the release of the hormone  oxytocin . Oxytocin is responsible for bonding, sexual pleasure and a mess of other human behaviors. Hugging promotes such a positive response within the body that it can reduce our  physical perception  of pain—which is why your parents kissing your scraped knees really did seem to help. Get physical I know you’ve  heard  that  working  out helps to reduce stress, but have you ever wanted to know why? Exercise helps  protect  the brain from anxiety-inducing effects of stress by increasing GABA receptors (or chemical messengers) in the hippocampus. GABA inhibits the brain’s ability to produce what would be your  normal stress  response by blocking those receptors in the hippocampus. To get the maximum benefits of this, you’ll have to exercise for longer than a day (think at least a month here). There are  many ,  many ,  many  other ways to reduce stress, but these are some that I use to help me deal. If you were still wondering about my eyelashes, rest assured I no longer pluck them out. One day I looked in the mirror and said, “Well, this is problematic.” I now try to manage my stress in more healthy ways. I bake, I run, I make myself laugh by posting things to  Twitter  that only I find amusing. I have an arsenal of stress reducing techniques up my sleeve. I know I can’t be successful at reducing my stress 100 percent of the time, but just knowing that I have some tips to fall back on makes dealing with stress a helluva lot easier.

According to CBS News , the snake was first spotted earlier this month and reports of the creature describe it anywhere from 15 to 20 feet long. Reptile expert Gerald Andrejack, who saw the snake firsthand, specified that the snake may in fact be one of the largest snakes in the world: an anaconda. “It’s a green anaconda,” Andrejcak told NJ.com . “I’ve known its species, but I was sworn to keep my mouth shut by local officials to avoid causing a panic. Now that there’s a panic, I’m going on the record.” Experts with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) however, are not as convinced. While there have been multiple sightings of the snake, both by homeowners near the lake and by those actively searching for it, there have been no pictures taken of the mysterious animal. The growing buzz over a possible anaconda in New Jersey’s largest lake drew wildlife officials to Lake Hopatcong, but they say the story may be over-exaggerated. “We’ve been trying to take this seriously, because if there is a dangerous creature we want to help capture it,” DEP spokesman Larry Ragonese told the Associated Press . “At this point, we’ve gone a couple weeks now with a growing story of an exotic creature roaming the lake, and there’s hundreds of eyes now trained on it. If there was to be something, you would think that that someone would have seen it.” Those who claim to have seen the animal, like Tony Colantonio, said there is no doubt that a large snake is roaming Hopatcong’s waters. Colantonio rents property near the lake and believes the snake may be bedding down near his house. Andrejcak believes that snake may have once been someone’s pet, and irresponsibly introduced to the lake when it grew too large. Green anacondas are the heaviest known snake species in the world and can weigh well over 100 pounds. They are native to the swamps of South America, but their size made the species popular with zoos and as private pets. Anacondas are fond of water and spend more time swimming than any other kind of snake. As popularized by several Hollywood movies, anacondas can move surprisingly fast in water and generally ambush prey from below the water’s surface. The snake then wraps itself around its prey and suffocates it. Contrary to popular belief, anacondas rarely target large animals and there are very few instances where a human is believed to have been consumed by one of these snakes. Anaconda or not, animal control officials warn residents to stay away from any large snakes they see in the area. “You don’t want to touch it. You don’t want to go towards it. You don’t want to threaten it. It’s not going to come at a person unless it’s threatened, cornered, caught—then, it will squeeze you to death,” said animal control officer Dale Sloat. “This big a snake would be aggressive.” Image from Ted on the flickr Creative Commons Any views or opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not reflect those of OutdoorHub.

He has high-end skill – his first overall selection in the 2012 Draft was no accident – and led all rookies in scoring in the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season. On the other hand, things went very, very, badly last season. What should we expect from him in the goal-scoring department in 2014-15? For those interested in a brief explanation of this series, see the first post in it (on Taylor Hall). Just a reminder about two things: I’m not projecting breakout seasons here (though they happen) and “comparables” are just the players inhabiting roughly the same roster position on the eight Western Conference playoff teams, and that empty-net goals are not included. It didn’t get a lot of attention, what with the minus-33 rating and occasional healthy scratches, but poor health was definitely part of the Yakupov story last year. TSN has him down as missing 16 games in all to ankle and head injuries after being the picture of health in 2012-13. Let’s peg him to miss half that, eight games, in 2014-15. Yakupov’s ice time over the last two years has been virtually identical. He played 12.1 minutes per game at even strength in both 2012-13 and 2013-14; betting on him to be in that range again seems likely. His power play ice time fell from 2:28 per game in 2012-13 to 2:10 in 2013-14. I have a hunch we’ll see him bounce back to that 2012-13 number (or higher), but let’s play it conservative and split the difference at 2:19. Yakupov’s shot rates at even-strength and on the power play over his two NHL seasons ( via ExtraSkater.com ) are as follow: Age % of Peak EV Shots/60 PP Shots/60 19 83.3% 5.4 11.2 20 86.7% 7.0 13.8 Projected 90.0% 6.6 13.2 Despite the poor campaign, Yakupov’s shot rates spiked at both even-strength and on the power play in 2013-14, and they spiked more than our aging curve expected. That’s good news, and suggests the projection here may well be on the conservative side. Using the above games played and ice time projections, Yakupov is expected to fire 98 shots at even strength and an additional 38 on the power play. On his career he’s a 12.5 percent shooter at even-strength. Given that his career only consists of 136 shots in those situations, normally I’d dial that number down, but my eyes tell me this guy is a special finisher (not just my eyes, either; Red Line Report marked him as having the best shot in the 2012 draft and described him as having “tremendous release on a heavy shot… and can fit it through a keyhole”). If I’m right in leaving the shooting percentage as is, we would expect 12 goals at even-strength . Yakupov’s power play shooting percentage on his career is 17.3 percent; my best guess is that it makes sense to move that halfway back toward his even-strength number, which would make him a 14.9 percent shooter. If that number is accurate, we would expect six goals on the power play . Total: 18 goals. It’s not a great number for a first overall pick’s third season, though it is a big step up from last season’s 11-goal outing. Yakupov’s going to be awfully hard to predict – he could go anywhere from first unit power play to less ice time than last year, and at evens he’ll either benefit from the improvements on the wing or see them cut into his opportunities. Anaheim: Jakob Silfverberg (10) Colorado: Maxime Talbot (7) St. Louis: Derek Roy (9) San Jose: James Sheppard (4) Chicago: Kris Versteeg (12) Los Angeles: Tyler Toffoli (11) Minnesota: Dany Heatley (11) Dallas: Antoine Roussel (13) Average: 10 goals. Derek Roy’s name is going to raise a few eyebrows, but he spent a bunch of time on the ice with Patrik Berglund and Vladimir Sobotka, so he’s slotted as a winger here rather than as one of the Blues’ four centres (the other two are David Backes and Max Lapierre). As a rule, even good NHL teams don’t get a lot of goal-scoring out of their No. 6 winger, but the Oilers are a special case. It’s a good thing, too – as we’ll see when we look at their second and third line centres next time out. 2014-15 goals projection series: Hall , Eberle , Nugent-Hopkins , Perron ,  Pouliot and Purcell The Oilers' new fourth line isn't really a fourth line All your centres are belong to Nashville 2008-09 Springfield Falcons - Five years later Follow Jonathan Willis on Twitter Jonathan Willis is a freelance writer.

With an expected full house at Semple Stadium in Thurles, it is an occasion not to be missed. Wexford and Limerick are first up at 2pm in what will be a titanic struggle in front of huge support from each county. Liam Dunne’s side are on a great run of games since they first drew with All-Ireland champions Clare in Ennis three weeks ago. They are a team that is growing in strength and confidence with each passing game. From my playing days with Offaly, we experienced first-hand in 1996 and ‘97 what it was like to come up against a highly motivated Wexford team with massive support behind them. When the Yellowbellies get their tails up they are hard to stop. They have their own tradition to look back on and that makes it easier to instil that inner belief that is required to win big games. Liam Dunne has unearthed a number of very good young hurlers with size such as Liam Ryan, Lee Chin, Conor McDonald, Liam Óg McGovern and Jack Guiney and he has also worked very hard on achieving the required levels of fitness to take on the top teams. This paid off in the extra time games against Clare and they finished very strongly against Waterford . The only concern is the number of games they have played in the last three weeks – including their victory in the Leinster U-21 final Their forwards are moving well and scored 3-12 from play against the Deise with eight players in total on the score sheet. The availability of Keith Rossiter could be crucial to the outcome of Sunday’s game. Limerick, on the other hand, had a very good win over Tipperary in the Munster semi- final but did not get up to the same level of intensity against Cork in the final . They missed a few chances early on in the game and were always struggling to keep up with the Rebels, who are a much improved side from last year and got the breaks on the day.  TJ Ryan will need to tighten up his back-line, who conceded 2-18 from play last time out.  They also need to get more from some of their key forwards such as Declan Hannon., Kevin Downes and David Breen. Some positional switches might also help these and other players. Limerick will pose a much stiffer challenge for Wexford than Waterford managed to put up. Both teams like to play a no nonsense direct brand of hurling and are at their best when really pumped up. It has the makings of a classic game and hopefully Barry Kelly will let the game run when he can.    We are down to the last six teams in the championship and while both these outfits are ranked as outsiders ther e is no reason why either of them cannot go on and win the All-Ireland. Look at what Clare did last year. Offaly did it in 1994 when we were written off and Wexford has their glory in 1996.     This is a huge game for both teams and I just fancy Wexford to come out on top on the basis that they are on a very good run of form. Their confidence is high and from past experience   when in that mood they are hard to beat. Dublin to bounce back against Tipperary: Tipperary and Dublin face up in the second game with Brian Gavin the man in the middle. The stakes are very high in this clash for all concerned. I do not see this encounter as being an open, flowing type of game. It will be more a game of attrition. The Dubs, with Anthony Daly at the helm, have been on the road now for a few years and have reached two All-Ireland semi-finals, only to come up slightly short in both. They had a good year in 2013 winning the Leinster title and almost beating Cork, but this summer has not gone as well, losing badly last time out to Kilkenny in the Leinster final.  It was a complete no-show by Dublin , who only managed to only score 1-5 from play, and this was not helped by the tactic of playing with an extra defender in the early stages. No one will have been more disappointed with their performance than the Dublin players and management and I expect a huge backlash in Sunday’s game. I would also suspect that Daly will make a few positional switches to freshen up the team and take away the predictability of their line-outs. To win they will need especially big performances from their two central defenders - Peter Kelly and Liam Rushe - and up front from all their forwards - but Conal Keaney and Danny Sutcliffe in particular. They will need to create and score goal chances as it is very difficult to see Dublin winning this game on points alone.     Tipperary, after their disappointing loss to Limerick, have since bounced back with good wins over Galway and Offaly. The victory against Galway got their year back on track and their supporters behind them. They came from six points down with 20 minutes to go to win by nine, outscoring Galway by 2-10 to 0-1 in that period. The Premier have unearthed a few good young players this year in Cathal Barrett, James Barry and John O’Dwyer. Seamus Callanan has been the star man up front, scoring 5-18 alone in the last two games and is getting great assistance from O’Dwyer, Noel McGrath and Lar Corbett.  Patrick ‘Bonner' Maher’s workrate is invaluable to the team.  Conor O’Mahony’s absence through injury is a big loss to Tipperary but Eamon O’Shea knows they have a huge challenge ahead of them on Sunday, which should ensure no complacency in the camp. When you match up the players head-to-head, then predicting the outcome of this game is not so clear cut. When both teams met in a crucial final round league game earlier this year, very little separated the sides. Dublin have been very competitive in knockout games over the last few years and if they can keep a rein on the Tipp forwards then I think Anthony Daly’s men can come away with a famous victory.  Watch live coverage of Limerick v Wexford and Dublin v Tipperary on RTÉ Two television from 1330.

The group actively tweeted on Mr Ruto’s Twitter timeline listing all the government websites it had infiltrated.

The group alleges that it has also infiltrated the Immigration and Registration of Person’s and the newly adopted government financial management information system (IFMIS) websites. The group actively tweeted on Mr Ruto’s Twitter timeline listing all the government websites it had infiltrated. “Immigration and Registration of Persons,” hacked read one tweet on Ruto’s timeline. The hacker, tweeting under @Anon_oxo3, gained access into Mr Ruto’s verified Twitter account and published a phone number alleged to be that of the Deputy President. Earlier on Monday, the group infiltrated Kenya Defence Force's (KDF) spokesperson Major Emmanuel Chirchir’s account and left a series of vulgar tweets. The official KDF account was also hacked into in the Monday incident. The group seems to be targeting government and senior government officials’ social media platforms such as websites and Twitter accounts for cyber-attacks. Besides hacking Mr Chirchir’s account twice, the group has also defaced the National Environment Trust Fund website which is under the Ministry of Environment. These cyber-attacks have put Kenya’s cyber security readiness on the spotlight as the government adopts e-governance for service delivery. The group is wreaking online havoc and fear as it seems bent on systematic disruption of government online activities. IT expert Mr William Makatiani, speaking to Daily Nation earlier, warned that Kenya would witness more cyber-attacks as it adopts IT and puts more data online. To keep hackers at bay, Daily Nation’s IT blogger John Walubengo recommends that strong passwords ought to be acquired for every account noting that weak passwords make it easy for hackers to infiltrate user accounts. Mr Walubengo further recommends that Internet users be wary of online promotions which promise users that they would win merchandise if they clicked on a link. The links end up opening computer hardware to viruses that hackers use to monitor keyboard activity and consequently gain access to passwords.

First, the federal bureaucracy — with its career employees enjoying near-bulletproof job security — is far more partisan than many Americans realized. From the IRS to the National Park Service to the EPA to the DOJ to the FCC, it’s difficult to find a federal agency that  hasn’t  abused its power to accomplish leftist political goals, whether those goals are near-term (like the IRS suppressing the Tea Party in the 2012 election or the National Park Service inflicting maximum pain during the government shutdown) or more long-term and structural (like the EPA and DOJ’s “ sue and settle ” strategy for implementing new regulations through contrived lawsuits or the IRS’s attempt to limit the First Amendment through the regulatory process). To the extent that many leading federal employees walled off their political beliefs from their professional lives, that wall has now been breached. Second, so long as the mainstream media agree with the bureaucracy’s preferred policy outcomes, it will give a free pass to the bureaucracy’s chosen political or legal methods. If the IRS had turned both barrels on the Occupy movement and leftist donors the same way it did the Tea Party and conservatives, there would be nothing “phony” about that scandal. The  New York Times  would be braying for impeachment after the first destroyed hard drive. But by its relative silence, the media have proven to us that it believes the ends justify the means.  These two facts taken together mean that the next conservative president should prepare to confront an executive branch that will likely engage in large-scale resistance to his or her preferred policies. Republican presidents have faced such challenges before, but with a bureaucracy empowered by the knowledge that it can — so far, at least — get away with large-scale conspiracies to deprive Americans of their civil rights with the tacit approval of the mainstream media and enthusiastic support of the far Left, expect many career employees of the executive branch to undermine a conservative president on an unprecedented scale. Further, as this new president confronts an increasingly lawless executive branch, expect that any effort to seize or maintain control will be cast by the mainstream media as a brutal conservative power play, the crushing of dissent to suppress “marginalized voices” — think of “war on women” rhetoric with the  volume set to eleven . President Obama feels empowered by his pen and phone because he knows — beyond a shadow of a doubt — that he enjoys the enthusiastic support of legions of federal workers. It’s the result — as Kevin Williamson has noted many times — of the merger between the party of government and the government itself. And even if the party of government (temporarily) vacates the White House, the government itself — the product of the Left’s “long march” through our key cultural institutions – will remain, possessing more true power than the president himself.  If conservatives believe we can halt the “fundamental transformation” of this country merely by electing a president, we are sadly mistaken. Much more work is required.

Last night’s defeat to Olympiakos proved that Milan are in need for reinforcements. Milan were without a number of important players and the players that took the field against the Greek were humbled as they conceded three goals. The Rossoneri’s number one concern appears to be a right winger but the midfield and defense were also very poor on Thursday night. Before the match, Adriano Galliani, who is in Italy and not with the squad in America, addressed the market. Di Marzio: “Strong Milan interest in Arsenal’s Campbell” Robinho lawyer: “I think that we will find a solution” “Robinho? We are waiting for more offers, we’ll see after Monday. Orlando City? We are in very advanced talks, but the negotiation won’t be completed successfully, we are very distant. The offer and the request are very distant. Robinho like Kakà? Not necessarily, things might go in a different way,” Vice President and CEO Galliani told the press yesterday. Milan have made it clear that they are unable to buy players before others leave and Robinho is blocking everything at the moment. “Alessio Cerci? As long as Robinho doesn’t leave, we won’t be able to do anything, if and when he’ll leave, we’ll think about it,” he added. “Adel Taarabt (who is reportedly still waiting for an offer to return to Milan)? It’s a possibility, but Pippo prefers a left-footed attacker and we’ll try to satisfy his request. Douglas Costa? I never discussed him with anyone. Costa is a very strong player, but also very expensive because he has a €50 million release clause so he’s out of reach. “Balotelli? Gandini and coach Inzaghi inform me of how he behaves, but he’s a great player and we must not demonize him. Mastour? He’s a very talented kid, we need to make him grow without giving him too many responsibilities. We managed to keep him even though many wanted him. At 16 he could have left for free, but luckily we kept him. He’s a player of the 1st team, he’ll always train with them, then we’ll see where he’ll play on Sunday’s (1st team or Primavera).” It was reported earlier this week that Filippo Inzaghi has decided that he wants Zaccardo to stay at the club and blocks his exit.

The clip was important because Gruber", "content"=>"Last night, a video surfaced showing Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber saying in January 2012 that if states do not set up their own exchanges under Obamacare, they lose access to the law. The clip was important because Gruber is an influential health policy analyst who helped author parts the law and consulted with multiple states on the implementation of their exchanges. His statement matched both the plain language of the law, which says subsidies are only available state-established exchanges, and the argument made by legal challengers who have argued in court that the Obama administration’s implementation of the law—which allowed subsidies in federally run exchanges via an Internal Revenue Service rule—is illegal. The timing was also notable. Gruber made the statement before the paper laying out the legal case against the administration's implementation had been published, and before the legal challenge against it had been filed.  Gruber has over the past year and a half repeatedly taken the other side of the argument, saying on MSNBC this week, \"It is unambiguous this is a typo. Literally every single person involved in the crafting of this law has said that it's a typo, that they had no intention of excluding the federal states.\" This morning, in response to the clip, Gruber told The New Republic that the comment was a mistake. \"I honestly don’t remember why I said that. I was speaking off-the-cuff. It was just a mistake,\" he said. He continued: \"There was never any intention to literally withhold money, to withhold tax credits, from the states that didn’t take that step\" [of creating their own exchanges].  That’s clear in the intent of the law and if you talk to anybody who worked on the law. My subsequent statement was just a speak-o—you know, like a typo. \" But as it turns out, earlier in the month, he made the exact same point, using similar language, once again calling the possibility that states won’t set up their own exchanges a \"threat\" to the law, and saying that residents in states that don’t set up their own exchanges would not have access to tax credits. \"The third risk, and the one folks aren’t talking about, which may most important of all, is the role of the states. Through a political compromise, it was decided that states should play a critical role in running these health insurance exchanges. And health insurance exchanges are the centerpiece of this reform, because they are the place that individuals can go to shop for their new, securely priced health insurance. But if they are not set up in a way which is transparent, and which is convenient for shoppers, and which allow people to take their tax credits and use them effectively by health insurance, it will undercut the whole purpose of the bill. Now a number of states have expressed no interest in doing so. A number of states—like California, has been a real leader—one of, I think it was the first state to pass an exchange bill. It’s been a leader in setting up its exchange. It’s a great example. But California is rare. Only about 10 states have really moved forward aggressively on setting up their exchanges. A number of states have even turned down millions of dollars in federal government grants as a statement of some sort—they don’t support health care reform. Now, I guess I’m enough of a believer in democracy to think that when the voters in states see that by not setting up an exchange the politicians of a state are costing state residents hundreds and millions and billions of dollars, that they’ll eventually throw the guys out. But I don’t know that for sure. And that is really the ultimate threat, is, will people understand that, gee, if your governor doesn't set up an exchange, you're losing hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits to be delivered to your citizens.\" [ emphasis added ] If this is another mistake, it is an awfully strange one that just happens to match not only the statement he made a week later, but also the plain language of the health law and the argument advanced by legal challengers to the IRS rule allowing subsidies within Obamacare's federal exchanges.

According to  reports in Italy , Robinho’s move to Orlando City from Milan is more than likely doubtful. Milan CEO Adriano Galliani has admitted to discussions between the Lions and the Rossoneri, but the inability to match a transfer fee seems to be a problem. “For Robinho we are waiting for other offers, we’ll see on Monday,” Galliani said. “Negotiations with Orlando are advanced, but we are very far apart with regard to the numbers. The deal will not go through for economic reasons. Their offer and our request is very, very far away. Our relationship with Orlando is very good, but we are very far away. My prediction is that nothing will be agreed with Orlando.” Orlando City isn’t the only club courting the forward. Brazilian clubs Flamengo, Cruzeiro and Atletico Mineiro are also interested in the services of the former Real Madrid and Manchester City player,  according to the Orlando Sentinel.  Here’s more news regarding Orlando City’s push to MLS:  NEW ORLANDO CITRUS BOWL RENDERINGS REVEALED Orlando City won’t play in their downtown soccer-specific stadium until 2016, but will play in a $200 million-plus renovated Orlando Citrus Bowl Stadium once they kickoff in their first Major League Soccer game in 2015. City of Orlando leaders along with Florida Citrus Sports executives released updated renderings of Orlando City’s future home on Friday, which is expected to be completed by mid-November. The new-look Citrus Bowl will still have artificial turf however, replacing the previous turf that Orlando City played on from 2011-2013. HEATH DISCUSSES LAMPARD MOVE TO NYC FC From one Englishmen to another, Orlando City head coach Adrian Heath praised Frank Lampard’s move to fellow expansion club, New York City FC. The former Chelsea and England midfielder  joined New York City as their second Designated Player on Thursday,  joining former Spanish striker David Villa for their debut in 2015. “He’s had an unbelievable career,” Heath told SBI. “Frank arguably has gotten more out of his career than any player in the history of English football. He performs at the maximum, he’s consistent, he looks after his body, he looks after himself, know’s what he good at and he know’s what he’s bad at. “He’s been a great role model for players in England, I don’t care about the fact that he’s 36. All I know is he’s fit, and this year he broke the Chelsea (scoring) record. I have no doubt he’ll be a big hit in MLS. I think David (Beckham) was different because he’s one of the few players that his iconic status away from football transcended everything but certainly on the field, Frank will be very, very good for New York City.” Orlando City and New York City are set to join Major League Soccer in 2015 as expansion clubs. OCSC will play their first season in a renovated Orlando Citrus Bowl Stadium before moving into their soccer-specific stadium in 2016. Meanwhile, NYCFC will play their home games at Yankee Stadium. — – What do you think of these developments?  Can Orlando City manage to acquire Robinho?

He absolutely got the most out of his talent and presented a product that was very entertaining for our students and fans to watch. “We wish him the best of luck as he embarks on the next chapter of his basketball career.” A former sharpshooting guard on West Virginia teams that reached the Elite Eight and Sweet 16, Beilein will join Quin Snyder’s staff “in a player development and video coordinator role,” according to a report from Yahoo Sports’ Adrian Wojnarowski, who first broke the story citing NBA sources. Beilein, 31, the son of ex-WVU and current Michigan coach John Beilein, had a 32-27 record in his stint as a college head coach, highlighted by a 20-12 record last season. He interviewed for the head coaching position at Marist in June, a job that ultimately went to another coach with WVU ties, Mike Maker of Division III Williams College. After becoming a 1,000-poit scorer for the Mountaineers, Beilein served as a graduate assistant at Michigan and a full-time assistant at Dartmouth.

Chlorinated Pools May Increase Cancer Risk Elite swimmers should use their backstroke and freestyle kick to make themselves go faster, not waste it trying to keep themselves upright if they want to get an edge in the pool, say Australian sport scientists. The findings are based on a new computer model of the rotational effects of buoyancy on drag, published in the Journal of Applied Biomechanics. \"Kicking is very inefficient at generating propulsion so every little bit that you can get out of the kick is going to be a good thing,\" said senior author, David Pease, from the Australian Institute of Sport. Olympic Tech Faster Than Skin: Photos Play Video Extreme Sports Risk-Taking Explained Ever wonder why some people are more likely to take risks than others? Ross Woodhall/Taxi/Getty Images Swimmers try to minimize their drag by keeping a streamlined horizontal alignment. But hand and arm movement tends to cause the lower body of a swimmer to rotate around so their legs sink. It has previously been hypothesized that an upwards buoyancy force, operating at a distance from the swimmer's center of mass helps counteract this. But to date there has been limited evidence for the drag-counteracting effects of this \"buoyancy torqu.\" Pease and colleagues developed a computer model of the rotational effects of buoyancy during freestyle, backstroke, butterfly and breaststroke. They took laser body scans and video footage of national-level athletes to capture their motion and produce 3D biomechanical computer models of their swimming. The researchers then calculated the position of each swimmer's centers of mass and buoyancy. They found evidence to support the idea that a buoyancy torque helps keep swimmers horizontal. How Tech Is Screwing Up the Olympics: Photos During swimming the center of buoyancy is closer to the feet than the center of mass, and buoyancy torque causes the legs to rise and the head to lower, says co-author Dr Raymond Cohen, a research scientist at CSIRO. \"This is surprising because if you are just lying horizontally in water your legs tend to sink,\" he said. \"But when you swim your arms and upper body tend to go out of the water and the position of the center of buoyancy ends up being closer towards your feet than your center of mass. \"The buoyancy torque assists the legs in counteracting the torques generated by the arms and hands which are typically in the opposite direction.\" The researchers say the findings are most relevant to freestyle and backstroke which naturally have better buoyancy torque since more of the upper body is out of the water in these strokes. According to Pease the findings have important implications for the way swimmers are coached on kicking technique. \"A lot of people think they have to kick up and down hard just to keep their legs up (but) their legs are going to stay up anyway because of the way all the torques are working.\" Pease says the findings suggest swimmers should waste less of their kicking energy keeping horizontal, and more of it on moving forward faster through the water. \"We can work on adjusting the technique of the kick in particular so that it can be more propulsive,\" he said. \"The best way to do this is to maintain good ankle flexibility so the swimmers are pressing water backwards.\" Less than 10 percent of a kick is propulsive, says Pease, so even if this gives just a small increase in speed it is going to be an advantage.", "score"=>158.13242, "summaryTitle"=>"Flexible Kick May Help Swimmers Rule the Pool", "type"=>"search", "description"=>["The kick should be used more to propel than to keep the body aloft, finds research.", "The kick should be used more to propel than to keep the body aloft, finds research."], "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://news.discovery.com/adventure/flexible-kick-may-help-swimmers-rule-the-pool-140725.htm", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "google.com", "dne.ws", "t.co", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/UxUcPh", "lastseen"=>"20140726004101", "page"=>"http://news.discovery.com/adventure/flexible-kick-may-help-swimmers-rule-the-pool-140725.htm", "ogtitle"=>"Flexible Kick May Help Swimmers Rule the Pool : DNews"}, {"domain"=>"pcworld.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406291021000", "h2"=>["Gaming games", "Worth the price of admission", "Related Slideshows", "Latest Videos", "PCWorld CATEGORIES", "Get PCWorld's Digital Editions"], "h3"=>["Hayden Dingman @haydencd   Jul 25, 2014 3:30 AM", "More Slideshows", "Varidesk Single review: This sit-stand desk has some ergonomic issues", "IDG Network Sites"], "site"=>"www.pcworld.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004043", "keywords"=>"Gaming,Gaming,games", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335243350", "title"=>"The 17 best free PC games | PCWorld", "initial"=>"20140725122341", "summaryText"=>"Close Varidesk Single review: This sit-stand desk has some ergonomic issues May 13, 2014 3:00 AM This tool is designed to let you work from both sitting and standing positions, but it's far from perfect.

With so much being released, it was easy for pairs to fly past your radar undetected. Sometimes you just slept on a couple designs, but later realized how amazing the design was after the shoe was long gone from the clearance rack. One of the most underrated kicks of the decade had to be the Nike Air Raid, which is releasing this Saturday at Champs Sports . With the “Peace” colorway release almost here, as well as the “Peace” colorway of the AF1 , we take a look at other slept-on shoes of the ‘90s. Some shoes are just instant classics, others take a little bit of time to get to that level. These are the sneakers that fall in the latter part of the category.

Today we're all aware, at least we should be, that the mobile market is significant when developing anything for the web. For years there has been discussion and differing points of view about native applications versus web applications and on which is the best. Regardless of your opinion, it used to be a fact that native mobile applications allowed to access hardware components that web pages couldn't. But is this gap still valid today? Have web technologies improved to the point where we, as developers, can code with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? In this article I'll introduce some JavaScript APIs that allow your web pages to access hardware components of mobile devices or that can empower your web application on mobile devices. Battery Status API The Battery Status API provides information about the system's battery level or status. Thanks to this API you are able to know if the battery is charging or not, how long before the battery will be fully discharged, or simply its current level. These details are accessible through four properties that all belong to the window.navigator.battery object. This API also defines events that can be fired when there are changes in the mentioned properties. This API is useful in cases such as where you (or your users) are on a bus working hard on a document using a web application and forgot to save the changes you made. Suddenly, your smartphone shuts down and you go crazy because you have lost a lot of time and all your work. Thanks to this API we can develop pages able to detect the current level of the battery and save changes more frequently to prevent data loss in case it's low or critical. At the time of writing the Battery Status API is only supported by Firefox but detecting support for this API is easy and is shown below: if (window.navigator && window.navigator.battery) { // API supported } else { // Not supported } A simple example of using this API is the following: // Print if battery is charging or not console.log(\"The battery is \" + (navigator.battery.charging ? \"\" : \"not\") + \" charging\"); If you want to experiment with this API, we have a demo just for you . If you want to investigate further, we have covered the Battery Status API here at SitePoint. Web Notifications API On mobile devices we're familiar with the concept of notifications, they are implemented by many apps that we have installed on our devices. On the web, websites implement them in different ways. Think of Google+ and Twitter, they both have a notification mechanism but the implementations are different. The Web Notifications API is an API created with this aim, to standardize the way developers notify users. A notification allows alerting a user outside the context of a web page of an event, such as the delivery of email. While the way developers can create a notification is the same, the specifications don't describe how and where a UI should display them. This means that we'll see different styles on different browsers. For example on mobile devices we may see them in the notifications bar. The Web Notifications API is exposed through the Notification property of the window object. It's a constructor that allows us to create a notification instance. To create a new notification, we can write code like the following: var notification = new Notification('Email received', { body: 'You received an email. Read it. Now!' }); Currently, the API is supported by Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. The mobile browsers that support the Web Notifications API are Firefox, Android 4.4+, and Blackberry. Do you see something weird? Chrome mobile doesn't support the API! Sad but true. Due to the browsers that do support this API, more than half the market is covered but because we want to be sure our JavaScript code doesn't try to call unsupported methods, we have to test for support. We can do that employing the following snippet: if ('Notification' in window) { // API supported } else { // Not supported } Excited by this API? Great! You can read more about it in the article “ An Introduction to the Web Notifications API ” and also play with a live demo . Proximity API The Proximity API is a JavaScript API that we can use to detect the proximity of an object to the device where the web page is running. The distance is measured by a proximity sensor, if your device has one. The Proximity API doesn't provide properties or methods, only two events fired on the window object. We can listen for them to perform operations. The first event, deviceproximity , provides information about the actual distance between the device and a nearby object, while the second event, userproximity , only specifies if there is an object nearby. The only browser that supports this API is Firefox, both on desktop and mobile, starting from version 15. Unfortunately, because many laptops and desktops don't have a proximity sensor, we have to target mainly mobile devices. To detect support for this API: if ('ondeviceproximity' in window) { // API supported } else { // Not supported } A simple example of use is shown below: window.addEventListener('userproximity', function(event) { console.log( (event.near ? '' : 'no ') + 'object detected nearby'); }); If you want to read more about the Proximity API, I wrote an article titled “ Introducing the Proximity API “. In case you want to see it in action, you can play with this demo . Vibration API The Vibration API is a very simple API, consisting of one method that gives us the power to vibrate a device. One obvious use is in games where we can recreate effects introduced a decade ago by some consoles. However, this isn't the only possible use of this API. As I mentioned, the Vibration API exposes only one method called vibrate() . The latter belongs to the window.navigator object and accepts, in its simplest form, an integer that specifies the number of milliseconds the device should vibrate. This API is supported by all major browsers except Internet Explorer and Safari. Despite this, it may be the right time to use it in your next project. In fact, if it's supported, you'll offer your users a better experience (unless you abuse of this feature, of course). Detecting for support is very easy and it's shown below: if (window.navigator && window.navigator.vibrate) { // API supported } else { // Not supported } A very simple use of the API is the following: // Vibrate for three seconds navigator.vibrate(3000); To learn more about this API read the article “ How to Use the HTML5 Vibration API ” and don't forget to play with the demo . Device Orientation API The last API I want to discuss is the Device Orientation API . Detecting the orientation of a device is useful for a wide range of cases, from navigation applications to games. This API defines several events that provide information about the physical orientation and motion of a device. This API is a W3C Working Draft, which means the specification isn't stable and we may expect some changes in the future. The API exposes the following three events deviceorientation , devicemotion and compassneedscalibration . The first is fired when the accelerometer detects a change of the device orientation. The second is triggered every time the device accelerates or decelerates. The last event is fired when the user agent determines the compass requires calibration. This API is supported by almost every major browser (except Safari) but the support is partial or has inconsistencies. For example, at the time of writing, very few browsers support the compassneedscalibration event. So, my advice is to test for each of these events to know if it's supported. To test for the presence of the deviceorientation event you can write: if (window.DeviceOrientationEvent) { // Event supported } else { // Not supported } or alternatively: if (!('ondeviceorientation' in window)) { // Event supported } else { // Not supported } If, for example, you want to test for the devicemotion event, you can write: if (window.DeviceMotionEvent) { // Event supported } else { // Not supported } In case you want to play with this API we have a demo that you can use . If you want to study it, we have the article “ Using Device Orientation in HTML5 “. Conclusions In this article I showed you some APIs that can empower your web pages for mobile visitors. The use cases for these APIs are endless and it all depends on your fantasy and the type of application or website you're developing. I hope you enjoyed this article, let me know of any other APIs you think may be useful.

This is our final set of impressions, so be sure to check up on our previous postcards , and we hope you enjoyed the series! Well, here we are, friends. End of the Postcards from WildStar line. You've met my purple-haired, green-eyed defender of the forest, and tagged along as she fought her way through Dominion foes and savage beasts. You've been welcomed into her home and watched in horror as she died – often – in WildStar 's PvP. Though to be fair, the \"horror\" part might just have been me. (I'm not very good at PvP!) MMOs are monstrous beasts and massive undertakings. They require a significant time commitment and sometimes month-to-month monetary compensation. The goal with these postcards has been not to give a finalized review, but to offer thoughts and impressions on the many aspects of Carbine's entry in the genre. Having poked and probed around for nearly two months now, I'm ready to wrap things up and give a summary conclusion. Read on to see where I place WildStar in the annals of MMO history. WildStar (PAX East 2013) As I said back in my very first postcard, WildStar has an artistic design that stands apart from much of its competition in modern gaming. While many developers have used the increased capabilities of today's PCs to produce more realistic graphics, Carbine takes WildStar in the opposite direction, focusing on smooth – but exaggerated – animations and environments bursting with so much saturated color you'll think you've died by drowning in a bowl of Fruity Pebbles. The effect this has on players is two-fold: First, it makes the game stand out. While realistic graphics will impress for a time, graphics with style and personality will age much better; as an MMO, longevity is crucial to WildStar 's success. Second, it allows for more users. Not everyone has a liquid-cooled tower capable of turning into Skynet while simultaneously running a dozen copies of Crysis 3 at max settings, so it's wise for Carbine to have a game that can scale well to hardware. I myself have run the game on a five-year-old laptop without any lag by turning the graphics down. Now, neither of these things would matter much if WildStar didn't execute on them well. Thankfully, while the game is not without its bugs, I've not run into any issues regarding connection stability or performance issues. As for the animation, just watch any of the \"WildStar Flicks\" available on the WildStar YouTube channel to see how talented the team at Carbine is. I could write an entire paragraph about how much I love the way the camera swings to the side when my character sprints forward and begins to turn. I won't, so fear not. Just be aware that, you know ... I could . From double-jumping and emoting to attacking and traversal, WildStar wears its comic book-inspired personality on its sleeve, and I admire the game for being so unabashedly fun. It's not perfect, but the sense of purpose in each of its individual gameplay systems – housing, PvE, PvP, combat, classes, paths, and so forth – gives it an overarching sense of cohesion matched by few in the genre, and that's a strength not to be underestimated. When World of Warcraft , now thought of as the de facto MMORPG, entered the arena in 2004, its biggest strength wasn't in changing up the MMORPG formula, but in making that formula accessible, understandable and appealing. WildStar follows in those thoughtful footsteps. Take, for instance, the player housing system; while many MMOs feature player housing, WildStar incorporates it in a way that makes it feel like a mainline feature, not an ancillary experiment or timesink. By decorating your house, you earn rest XP, which allows you to level up faster, thus allowing you to tackle quests and challenges all the sooner. They in turn allow you to earn gold or loot rewards for more décor, turning housing into something as addictive as hunting down the next great piece of armor or weaponry. Player housing and gear acquisition both exist within the MMO space, but WildStar is the game that most expertly combines them and makes them exciting. If you remain unconvinced, look to how WildStar handles questing. While most quests still amount to the same \"go here, kill/fetch/interact with X\" structure you've seen a hundred times, there are often challenges tied to them that encourage and reward skillful completion. Let's say I need to kill 10 of a certain monster for a quest – when I slay the first one, a challenge might begin that tasks me with killing 12, 15, 20 or some other number of that monster within a time limit. Succeed, and you'll earn extra rewards, like decor for your home or crafting supplies. Suddenly, my mind switches from the tedious grind of \"go here, do this\" to \"I have to hunt these things down fast!\" Again, I'm not doing anything radically new or different from what other MMOs ask me to do, but I'm doing it in a way that it doesn't feel like a chore. The fact that there is an abundance of spaces to explore and things to do - I've been playing quite frequently for almost two months and have yet to hit level cap - is just icing on top of the carrot cake. So here, at the end of our postcard series, you're wondering about the million-dollar question: Is WildStar the fabled \" WoW -killer\"? No. The only thing that will \"kill\" Blizzard's behemoth is time. However, based on what I've played of the game, I'm confident in calling WildStar a successor to WoW 's throne. To be sure, these are two different games with their own fans, and they should be judged on their own merits. Nevertheless, it's a comparison many are quick to make, and I'd like to address it. If you must view WildStar in relation to WoW , let me say this: WildStar does things differently enough, interestingly enough, and streamlined enough to make it feel like the game Blizzard would make in 2014. It is, in almost everything except name, World of Warcraft 2 . Hyperbole? Maybe a bit. But then, Carbine Studios is made up of many of the people who made WoW what it is. If anyone's going to outdo their previous work, might as well be themselves. Honestly, I'm having too much fun to think about it too much.", "score"=>158.05812, "summaryTitle"=>"Postcards from WildStar: See you, space cowboy", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Welcome to Postcards from WildStar, a look at Carbine's new MMO.

Yet there have been few batsmen who have been able to score runs at this historic ground. Let us take a look at Top 5 batsmen to score most runs at Lord's in Test Cricket 5) Dilip Vengsarkar  - 508 Runs - The only overseas batsmen to score 3 centuries at Lord's. Vengsarkar has scored 508 Runs in 8 innings of the 4 test matches he has played. Though he has scored 3 centuries and one 50 at Lord's his team has been able to win just one match of the 4 he has played at Lord's. It is not easy to score a century and scoring 3 at Lord's in 4 matches is something out of the ordinary that Dilip Vengsarkar has managed to do. 4) Shivnarine Chanderpaul  - 512 Runs - The only batsmen of this era to make it to this list. Chanderpaul has batted for 9 innings in the 5 test matches he has played and managed to score 512 runs at an average of 85.83. This West Indian batsmen who has a style of his own has found it easy to score at Lord's. With 1 century and four 50s, Chanderpaul is fourth on this list. 3) Don Bradman  - 551 Runs - In 8 innings of 4 test matches, Bradman has scored 551 Runs at an average of 78.00 which is quiet less compared to his career average. With an highest of 254 at Lord's, the legend has scored couple of 100s and one 50 at this ground. 2) Gary Sobers  - 571 Runs - This West Indian legend is second in the list with 571 runs, that have come of 9 innings in 5 matches. Gary has scored at an average of 95.00 at Lord's which might be less compared to that of Warren's but in it still a great one. He has also scored couple of 100s and 50s at Lord's. 1) Warren Bardsley  - 575 Runs - Old is Gold. This Australian batsmen who played in England between 1909-1926. He scored 575 runs in the 7 innings he played of 5 test matches. Warren has scored at Lord's at an average of 115.00 and also managed to score couple of 100s and 50s as well. He has been one those few batsmen who loved batting at Lord's. Graham Gooch  (England) is the highest run getter at Lord's overall. With 2015 runs in 21 matches (39 innings). He has scored 6 centuries and 5 fifties at Lord's with 333 being his highest score.

And, honestly, he doesn't think Tiger Woods is all that sociable. A co-host on the Mike Missanelli Show on 97.5 FM The Fanatic in Philadelphia on Friday, Barkley was asked by a caller if he is still friends with Tiger. \"We're not friends anymore,\" Barkley answered, before entering into a slightly longer consideration of what it's like to really know Woods. Responding to a claim from Missanelli that Woods has too far removed himself from the rest of society, Barkley said, \"Well I think that when you're as great as he has been, and this probably is a negative at some point, like he was so consumed with being the greatest golfer ever, he wasn't a very sociable guy. Even when was a friend of mine, he wasn't a very sociable guy. He just had a one-track mind. He just wanted to break Jack Nicklaus ' record.\" Barkley later added: \"Golf is just a game. Your life don't suck. ... But I think when you put yourself in that situation where your whole life revolves around how you're doing on a golf course, you're gonna develop a negative attitude to a certain degree, instead of saying, 'I've actually got it pretty good.' It's like people who say I never won a championship. I understand that. I accept that. But it ain't like I'm sitting around saying, 'Oh my God, my life sucks. This is so miserable.\" Friends for years, Barkley and Woods stopped speaking after Woods' well-publicized car accident and scandal in November 2009, and this is not the first time Barkley has been publically critical of his former friend. As he told ESPN New York's Mike Lupica Show in 2011:  \"You think you're friends with a guy. You talk to him once a week for 15 years. You're like, this dude is my friend, we do things, we have fun together,\" Barkley said. \"I haven't talked to him in two years and I'm wondering what the hell is going on.\" \"I'm sitting back like everyone else and saying, what the hell is going on? I just feel sad, to be honest with you. You're like, dude, who is around this guy, who has his back, who has his best interest, who doesn't want anything from him? I don't know why we haven't talked to him in a couple of years.\" Barkley has repeatedly denied public speculation that he and Michael Jordan were any kind of negative influence on a younger Tiger. He's also made frequent mention - both during and after the friendship - that both Woods and Jordan are exceedingly cheap . ", "score"=>158.04877, "summaryTitle"=>"Barkley: Tiger isn't a 'very sociable guy'", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Charles Barkley is rarely one to be anything less than honest.

You was their loss not the other way around.  People come and go. One’s life is like a revolving door with entries and exits. Some touch our lives and make a difference, others leave no visible sign that they were even there, so insignificant is their presence, their very absence no longer felt or even missed. Some are irreplaceable and their absence makes the heart feels torn apart as though a tiny part of it left with their departure. It’s heartbreaking to endure this aching loss forever more. ~ Margaret Young  Some come in and no matter how much you may think you want them back time will come. You’re so grateful for a lesson learned and cannot even imagine returning to someone who was willing to see you as less, asked you to compromise who you are, made you for settle for less for so long that you got your knees and actively thank God for the lessons of the past not having to be the lessons of your future. I at least finally at some point understood that I was a bright shiny child of God and I deserved the best of everything that his world on earth and in Heaven had to offer. ~ Dina Marie  There are several people that have been in my life and I loved them very much, when they left I was so heart broken and thought I would never find another to love. But that’s not true, people come and go all the time. I have learned to just enjoy what time we had together. ~ Thomas Rubenstein  Looking at “replacing” them is a mistake. If we see each person we meet as an individual with their own unique strengths and weaknesses it’s more realistic to move on if we lose them. But I get that what some people bring into our life is so unique and so affecting that it’s hard to imagine finding that again in someone else. And in order to heal, move on, let go, etc., we have to have faith that the way we felt with those we’ve lost can be felt again with someone new. ~ Kelli Gatlin  Share your thoughts on what this post means to you... comments", "score"=>158.04459, "summaryTitle"=>"Some people come into your Life", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.informativequotes.com/some-people-come-into-your-life-2/", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "direct", "bit.ly"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1rE1PRg", "lastseen"=>"20140726004440", "page"=>"http://www.informativequotes.com/some-people-come-into-your-life-2/"}, {"domain"=>"fearnet.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406322793000", "h2"=>["Search form", "Movies", "Shows", "Shorts", "Videos", "Highlights", "Headlines", "Movie Reviews", "Most Popular Threads", "Most Recent Threads", "News Article", "The Walking Dead Season 5 Trailer and Premiere Date", "Tonight on FEARNET TV", "Related Content", "Around The Web", "Footer Links"], "site"=>"www.fearnet.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004228", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335348140", "title"=>"The Walking Dead Season 5 Trailer and Premiere Date | News Article | FEARNET", "initial"=>"20140725211313", "summaryText"=>"Jump to Navigation", "content"=>"Jump to Navigation", "score"=>158.04285, "summaryTitle"=>"The Walking Dead Season 5 Trailer and Premiere Date", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"The Walking Dead just wrapped up their Hall H panel at Comic Con, and as has been the case for the last several years, they unvield a trailer and the actual premiere date for the upcoming season.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.fearnet.com/news/news-article/walking-dead-season-5-trailer-and-premiere-date", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "direct", "fearnet.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1phdiVd", "lastseen"=>"20140726004220", "page"=>"http://www.fearnet.com/news/news-article/walking-dead-season-5-trailer-and-premiere-date", "ogtitle"=>"The Walking Dead Season 5 Trailer and Premiere Date"}, {"domain"=>"blindgossip.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406317658000", "h2"=>"BLIND GOSSIP", "h3"=>["Meta", "Archives", "Sources", "Friends", "Tags"], "site"=>"blindgossip.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004043", "keywords"=>"internet,model,television", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335243377", "title"=>"TV Star Set Up An Escort Profile | BLIND GOSSIP", "initial"=>"20140725194738", "summaryText"=>"[ Pop Bitch ] Which young TV star and model has set up an escort profile on the deep web – available via the Tor browser?

Among the new actors and the characters they will portray are: Alexander Siddig as Doran Martell. Doran Martell is the ruling lord of Dorne and older brother to the late Prince Oberyn Martell. Unlike his brother, Doran is even-tempered and deliberate. Now, all of Dorne waits to see how their lord will react to his brother’s death. Toby Sebastian as Trystane Martell. Trystane Martell is Prince Doran’s son and heir to Dorne. His father betrothed him to Myrcella Baratheon as part of the alliance offered by Tywin Lannister, then Hand of the King. Nell Tiger Free as Myrcella Baratheon. Myrcella Baratheon is officially the eldest child of Cersei Lannister and the late King Robert Baratheon, though in truth her father is Cersei’s own brother, Jaime Lannister. For years, she has been a guest and ward of Prince Doran, betrothed to his son, but her position has become tenuous   with the death   of Oberyn Martell, the   Prince’s brother. DeObia Oparei as Areo Hotah. Areo Hotah is the long-serving captain of Doran Martell’s palace guard, renowned for his loyalty and his longaxe. Enzo Cilenti as Yezzan. Yezzan was an extremely wealthy slave trader before Daenerys Targaryen outlawed the slave trade. Jessica Henwick as Nymeria (“Nym”) Sand. Nym Sand is the second eldest of the late Prince Oberyn’s bastard daughters. Her mother was an Eastern noblewoman who brought Nym up to be cultured, graceful and deadly with a whip. Rosabell Laurenti Sellers as Tyene Sand. Tyene Sand is the daughter of the late Prince Oberyn Martell by Ellaria Sand, his final paramour. Tyene is fiercer than she looks, especially with her twin daggers. Keisha Castle -Hughes as Obara Sand. A fearsome warrior, Obara Sand is the eldest bastard daughter of the late Prince Oberyn Martell. Her mother was a Dornish peasant girl who caught the eye of the late Prince. Jonathan Pryce as the High Sparrow. A devout and pious man, the High Sparrow came to King’s Landing to serve those forgotten by much of the world – the poor, the downtrodden and the infirm – and quickly amassed a large following. His fellow believers have swarmed over the city, ministering to the lowest and decrying the corruption of the highest. Based on the bestselling fantasy book series by George R.R.

Baxter says the balance in the way his team has been voted for and picked is not how he would have set out his team for battle in this contest which will roar into life at Soccer City Stadium before 90 000 fans. While the goalkeeping and defence lines have taken normal shape it is in midfield and attack where things have changed for the likes of Willard Katsande, George Maluleka, Reneilwe Letsholonyane, George Lebese, Katlego Mphela and Kingston Nkhatha. “The balance of the team that has been selected is a little bit unusual for us so we will have to play a little bit differently which is one of those challenges that the Black Label throws up. “I remember Roger de Sa telling me that they had two left-backs selected and we have an unusual balance in our team,” says Baxter pointing out his midfield that has Katsande, Yeye and Maluleka all starting. “When we start with a diamond that is okay because we play with three more central. However, we have always had a point at the head of the diamond with Shabba (Siphiwe Tshabalala) or Bernard (Parker) playing as an attacking midfielder. George (Lebese) cannot play that role so we will have to tweak it a little bit. However, we are getting used to this now because we now know that at this time of the year the Carling Black Label is coming. “This is more than a friendly game because this is a Derby game. It is still a Derby because everyone gets into the spirit of the event and it is usually an enjoyable occasion,” he says. Baxter adds that though he also appreciates that fans always expect an avalanche of goals it is vital for him as a coach to maintain balance. “Whenever you play you want to see goals because that is what the fans enjoy seeing as that is the signature on a beautiful painting. “When you have a beautiful painting and you don’t put the signature on it then it is not worth it so we want to do that (score goals). However, we want to do it in the right way, we don’t want to win games 6-5…we want to have some sort of balance about it. “We don’t want the attacking play to come at a cost to our solid defending which is the same the other way round because we don’t want to defend solid and never score goals because we never dare to creep out of the penalty area. It is about balance and I think the fans don’t have to take it into consideration but over a long season the coaches do,” he says. Baxter also notes that he is aiming to have his team getting more competitive this season. “We are looking to get better and not frustrated. We have to be more competitive and show more quality. We want to balance that with freshening the squad because that balance is important in that we don’t rock the boat too much but rock it enough to liven everybody else up,” Baxter adds.

By Olivia Chow (guest contributor) About three times a day, a pedestrian and a vehicle collide in our city. This month, three of those collisions resulted in pedestrian deaths. While no policy response can undo the pain any of these tragedies have caused, pedestrian fatalities are on the rise and it’s time we followed the lead of cities taking steps to make taking steps safer. These include New York City, London, and Vancouver, each of which has established a target of zero pedestrian fatalities. We should as well. About 5 per cent of people walk to work in Toronto. That’s about three times higher than the number who cycle, and it’s rising as city development intensifies. Factor in that at some point in almost everyone’s day they are a pedestrian, and the need to broaden our transport debate to include every mode of transport becomes clearer. It becomes clearer still when you consider that last year, 40 pedestrians died on our streets, compared to 12 drivers and four cyclists. That’s the most pedestrian fatalities in more than a decade, and this year already eight have been killed. Two issues arise from this, I believe. Are there ways we can start to make walking safer, especially for senior citizens, who represent more than half of pedestrian deaths? And can we have a debate about how people get around that’s inclusive, reflecting that our city moves in many ways: on foot, by wheelchair and bicycle, on the TTC, or by car? For the last four years, the answer to the second question has been no. We’ve fallen into the false debate in which improvements made for people who walk or cycle, drivers automatically lose. It’s a false debate because nobody is a driver all the time, and there are ways we can reflect the city we now are without creating losers. Take, for example, Eglinton Connects. As the Crosstown LRT, which will be underground for parts of Eglinton, is built, there’s a plan to create a complete street. Its sidewalks will be wider, allowing for better people space, which will help businesses. It will also include bike lanes. Jennifer Keesmaat, the City’s chief planner, says it will increase the street’s carrying capacity because buses currently on the street will be replaced by LRT below. I’ve been to the public consultations on this promising idea, and know the neighbourhood wants it. Some of my fellow mayoral candidates agree, but others—Rob Ford and John Tory—don’t. They define traffic as cars only, and fail to consider that Eglinton is one of the places in the city where pedestrians outnumber cars. We need to help everyone get around better. This includes drivers, but must also include pedestrians. I released specific ideas in early May to make walking safer. Chief among them is allowing neighbourhoods to reduce speed limits on side streets by up to 10 kilometres per hour. New York City started doing this in 2011. We should copy the idea, and empower communities to act on a broader scale to make their streets safer. We should also simply make intersections safer by using common-sense fixes. These include longer cross times, which would be especially helpful to seniors who need more time to cross the street. Better lighting at intersections would help, too, considering pedestrian deaths tend to rise in November and December when there are fewer daylight hours. And the way we build intersections needs to change, too, by incorporating common-sense ideas such as right-angled curbs. Curved curbs help cars turn faster, leaving less time to look around. If they are square-edged, the vehicle has to slow down, giving more time for both driver and walker to see each other and prevent problems. But discussions such as this are hard to have in a context that pits one mode of transportation against another. In a city in which people get around in many ways, it’s time for a more holistic approach to transport planning—like the one we see on Eglinton Avenue. Too often, however, straw men derail steps forward. We saw this in Scarborough, where Rob Ford helped undermine support for world-class, above-ground rail by pretending it would run on a road. We see it in the discussion around Eglinton Avenue. We can do better, by reflecting our city as it is, and improving all ways people get around instead of pitting one mode against another.

The Geordie boy has impressed in his two games in pre-season so far and it is clear Newcastle have a battler on their hands in the flame-haired lad from Killingworth . Newcastle boss Alan Pardew and the coaching team are delighted by Colback’s application so far. United, who played Wellington Phoenix to wrap up their tour of New Zealand in the early hours of tomorrow morning, have competition in midfield next term with Cheick Tiote and Vurnon Anita both pushing for engine room slots. However, Colback said that settling in on the back of a controversial switch from Wearside on a free transfer, which resulted in Sunderland publishing a lengthy statement after being irked by the move, has been the most important factor. Colback said from Wellington today: “The biggest challenge for me has been coming into a new environment and meeting new players and staff. But the players have been great and the staff have been great and it has been an easy transition.

But Pardew, who spent plenty of time observing work-rates of his players, knows he must find a way of keeping Tiote, Anita and Colback happy and in his plans. Reflecting on training, Colback said: “The training has been good and the set-up has been good. “I am looking forward to the rest of the pre-season and getting the season under way.” And speaking about the quality of the opposition in Wellington, Colback added: “Their result the other night againt West Ham shows they are a decent outfit and we are fully prepared for another tough game and it is one we are looking forward to.”  ", "score"=>157.8636, "summaryTitle"=>"Jack Colback thanks Newcastle United for easy passage", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Midfielder delighted with switch to St James' Park so far", "cities"=>"gb", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jack-colback-thanks-newcastle-united-7509600", "referrer"=>["bleacherreport.com", "8red80.com", "t.co", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1rjfhrS", "lastseen"=>"20140726003851", "page"=>"http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jack-colback-thanks-newcastle-united-7509600", "ogtitle"=>"Jack Colback thanks Newcastle United for easy passage"}, {"domain"=>"vineyardvines.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406312641000", "h2"=>["Connect with Us", "Get on board!", "Request a catalog"], "h3"=>["We're currently stocking the pond and are looking to reel in qualified candidates to fill the following positions:", "Sign-up for our email list", "The Good Life is waiting..."], "site"=>"www.vineyardvines.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004525", "keywords"=>"employment, job, jobs, work, career", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335525537", "title"=>"Job Opportunities - vineyard vines", "initial"=>"20140725182401", "summaryText"=>"We're currently stocking the pond and are looking to reel in qualified candidates to fill the following positions:   Accessories Designer Apparel Designer - Wovens Men's/Boy's Art Director Graphic Production Artist Merchandise Planning & Allocation Manager", "content"=>"We're currently stocking the pond and are looking to reel in qualified candidates to fill the following positions:   Accessories Designer Apparel Designer - Wovens Men's/Boy's Art Director Graphic Production Artist Merchandise Planning & Allocation Manager Junior Applications Support Analyst Junior Sales Coordinator Technical Design Assistant Web Analytics Manager Store Managers Assistant Store Managers Part-time and Full-time Sales Associates Please click on the job title for more information.

Earlier this week the carrier announced that it’s offering no-questions-asked refunds or postponements on all tickets valid for travel in 2014 -- including previously non-refundable tickets. It’s a generous offer,", "content"=>"How grim can it get for Malaysia Airlines? Earlier this week the carrier announced that it’s offering no-questions-asked refunds or postponements on all tickets valid for travel in 2014 -- including previously non-refundable tickets. It’s a generous offer, and one that the airline no doubt expected many passengers to accept in the numb aftermath of its serial air disasters -- Flights MH370 and MH17. Indeed, of the 680 total air fatalities so far in 2014 -- another large crash and this will be the worst year for fatalities since 2005, according to Bloomberg News -- an astonishing 537 resulted from the ill-fated Malaysia Airlines flights. Who, at this point, wants to fly that airline? I do. In fact, I regularly fly Malaysia Airlines and have two reservations on the carrier (one actually on a subsidiary) for later this year. With apologies to friends and family who regularly send me notes such as, “You don’t need to fly Malaysia,” (and to the publisher who wrote “no Malaysia Air” on notes regarding a future book tour), I have no more intention of canceling those reservations than of canceling my reservations on Delta and American for next week. The reason is straightforward: Air travel remains the safest means of getting from point A to point B . (Moreover, prior to this year’s accidents, Malaysia Airlines had a stellar safety record.) It’s a point that Tony Tyler, director general and chief executive officer of the International Air Transport Association, made in a statement this week: Every day, approximately 100,000 flights take to the sky and land without incident. In 2013 more than three billion people flew and there were 210 fatalities. Regrettably, we have surpassed that number already this year. But even so, getting on an aircraft is still among the safest activities that one can do. Of course, that doesn’t minimize the tragic loss of life this week in Ukraine , Mali and Taiwan . There is grief to bear, mourning to be done and failures to be investigated -- to prevent similar accidents in the future. But even as causes and blame are assessed, it’s important to keep in perspective the stunning safety record that global air travel has achieved over many decades . According to the International Civil Aviation Organization’s most recent report on global air safety, the global air accident rate declined 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, from 3.2 accidents per million departures to 2.8 accidents per million departures. In real terms, that’s a decline from 99 fatalities in 388 accidents, to 90 fatalities in 173 accidents. In 2005 , by comparison, there were 119 accidents with 825 fatalities (and in 1985 there were more than 2,000 air crash deaths resulting from dozens of accidents). It’s also worth noting that the last decade’s decline took place during a period of “ historic growth rates ” for passenger traffic, globally. This has been an exceptionally bad week for flying. Nevertheless, according to Malaysia Airlines , neither the fatalities nor its generous refund policy has resulted in a surge in requests for refunds. For airlines and civil aviation authorities around the world, that’s a deserved vote of confidence. The skies remain safe.

The Americans went from shut out to clean sweep on Day 2 of the International Crown, posting four points to sit in a tie for second with Taiwan in Pool A. Thailand, a team of smiles, leads way in that pool with five points. It was more than a moral victory for Team USA. Imagine what Sunday at Caves Valley would look like with no home team? “We needed that little bit of a wake‑up call,” said Paula Creamer. Stacy Lewis gathered the team on the range Friday morning and gave a little pep talk, encouraging her teammates to fight and grind out there while having fun. Lewis and Creamer didn’t take control of their match against Spain until the seventh hole but held on tight til the 18th. Creamer jokingly credited a handshake with Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps for a mid-round inspiration. “We talked about that for two holes, you know,” Creamer said, beaming. There’s still plenty of work to do. Only the top two teams from each pool automatically advance. Teams in third place will have a two-person, sudden-death playoff on Saturday to determine the fifth spot. The last three teams in both pools are separated by one point. The American players likened Caves Valley to a major championship venue. Even bomber Lexi Thompson called it long. Nonetheless, Thompson hit a 7-iron into the par-5 12th and drained the putt for eagle to give the U.S. a 3-up lead over Spain it never relinquished. Thompson and Kerr dusted Belen Mozo and Beatriz Recari, 3 and 2, to give Team USA its first points of the competition. “I thought Lexi and I had a lot of chemistry out there together,” said Kerr. “We played with a lot of heart for each other.” Japan, bolstered by a dramatic six-hole comeback in the last seven holes, leads Pool B and all teams with six points while Korea sits in second with four. Katherine Kirk and Lindsey Wright, two former Pepperdine teammates, had a commanding six-hole advantage with seven holes to play but squandered it away. Consider that Japan won the 14th hole with bogey. On the par-3 17th, Sakura Yokomine drained a 50-foot birdie putt to extend the match to the 18th. It didn’t take much to seal the deal. Wright hit her second shot into the creek and Kirk missed the hole by miles with her par attempt. “We apparently went on safari on the back nine,” Kirk said. The Aussies shot 31-39 in the best-ball format. Wright said the group was put on the clock on the 12th hole. They lost their timing “and that was pretty much it.” For Japan, it was a day of patience. “We said that every hole is an extra bonus,” said Ai Miyazato, whose only birdie of the day came on 17. “It just happened. It was just amazing.” Caroline Hedwall put up the day’s best individual performance, notching two eagles and three birdies. The powerful Swede became the first player in Solheim Cup history to go 5-0 last year in Colorado. Hedwall drove the par-4, 282-yard fifth hole and was conceded the 4-foot eagle putt. On the par-5 12th, she drained a lengthy eagle putt. “I think I'm just aggressive player and when I play match play, I can really play aggressive because I can only lose a hole, you know,” said Hedwall. “While when I play stroke play, maybe I just get a little insecure.” Next up for the Americans is the Thai team, whose best player is 18-year-old Ariya Jutanugarn, younger sister to LPGA sophomore Moriya. The two sisters have paired together the first three days, earning three points, and will give fans more of the same on Saturday. “Today we were trying to beat each other,” Moriya said. Ariya clarifies: “Before I tee off, I say I’m going to make birdie. And she says, ‘No, I’m going to make birdie, too.’ ” Such competitive banter is all these two know, and they will surely give the Americans a tough battle. Rounding out Team Thailand is a pair of lesser-known players in Onnarin “Moo” Sattayabanphot and Pornanong Phatlum. Sattayabanphot played at Purdue and makes her living on the Japan LPGA. Phatlum is known on the LPGA as the player who matches her caddie/brother in wild attire and black leggings. On paper, Thailand is the obvious underdog, but Taiwan proved on Thursday that even the lowest seed can topple the Yanks. One thing is certain: The Thai players aren’t scared. “Team Thailand and the Americans, you never know tomorrow,” said Sattayabanphot. “Just come and watch.”", "score"=>157.82907, "summaryTitle"=>"U.S. rebounds to win four points at International Crown", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"The Americans went from shut out to clean sweep on Day 2 of the International Crown, posting four points to sit in a tie for second with Taiwan in Pool A.

Israel enjoys criminal impunity because of the direct support from governments in the North America and Europe but also from corporations that are implicated in the Israeli occupation and egregious human rights violations. There are dozens of companies that play an active and ongoing role in facilitating Israeli apartheid. In light of the exceptionally bloody massacres Israel is currently committing in Gaza, the Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC) suggests to BDS activists and every conscientious person and organization around the world to target the following 7 companies as a matter of urgency. READ MORE: Read our Get Involved page for more ideas on companies to boycott and ways to get involved in the Boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement 1. Hewlett Packard (HP) IT company Hewlett Packard is involved in various Israeli violations of international law through  providing the Israeli occupation forces with a vast range of IT services and infrastructure solutions . This includes the operation of an ID system installed in Israeli military checkpoints in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, and the administration of the IT system of the Israeli Navy that enforces the naval blockade of Gaza and that is deeply involved in committing war crimes in the ongoing aggression on Gaza. By providing such significant support to the Israeli military, HP is an active accomplice to Israel’s siege on Gaza. That’s why the Presbyterian Church USA and the Quaker Friends Fiduciary Corporation (FFC)  have divested from the company. Take action: - Boycott HP consumer products . Don’t buy HP laptops, printers or ink cartridges! - Sign the petition calling on HP CEO Meg Whitman to end the company’s collaboration with the Israeli military - Campaign for divestment from HP and for the company to be excluded from public contracts. Get in touch for ideas on how to get started. 2. Caterpillar Caterpillar bulldozers are regularly used in the demolition of Palestinian homes and farms, and the Israeli army has used unmanned Caterpillar bulldozers in the 2008-09 attacks in Gaza. A CAT bulldozer was also used by Israel in killing US activist Rachel Corrie in Rafah in 2003. The  Presbyterian Church USA , the  Quaker Friends Fiduciary Corporation (FFC)  and the Church of England have all divested from Caterpillar. Take action: -  Boycott Caterpillar consumer products such as shoes, bags and tools! - Campaign for divestment from Caterpillar. Get in touch for ideas on how to get started. 3. SodaStream While not directly implicated in Israel’s on-going attack in Gaza, home drink carbonation machines produced by SodaStream are one of Israel’s most visible and widely advertised exports. Tax revenue from SodaStream sales help to fund Israel’s attack on Gaza. SodaStream operates in the illegal Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim in the occupied West Bank, and the company’s plan to open a factory inside Israel beside Rahat, a planned Palestinian Bedouin township in the Naqab (Negev) desert, amounts to participation in Israel’s plans to forcibly displace at least 40,000 Palestinian Bedouins into townships. John Lewis in the UK recently became the latest retailer to stop stocking SodaStream products and protests forced a SodaStream store in Brighton, UK, to close recently. The company’s share price has fallen by 50% in the past year, especially since a scandal over actor Scarlett Johansson’s association with the brand . Take action: - Boycott all SodaStream products and call on retailers not to stock them! - Organise a demonstration or flashmob at a retailer near you that sells SodaStream products. Check out Codepink’s action guide for ideas. 4. Elbit Systems Elbit Systems is Israel’s largest military company. It provides a wide range of equipment and services to the Israeli military, including surveillance equipment used in Israel’s illegal Wall and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), known as drones. Elbit Systems armed drones are widely used by the Israeli military and were documented as being used in attacks on unarmed civilians during the 2008-09 assault on Gaza . According to Palestinian human rights organization Al Mezan Center, armed drones killed more than 1,000 Palestinians in Gaza in the period 2000-2010. Palestinian and international human rights organisations have reported numerous attacks on Palestinians by drones during the current attack on Gaza. Elbit Systems markets its drone technology across the world as ‘field tested’. Countries that have procured UAVs from Elbit include Australia, Canada, Croatia, France, Georgia, Mexico, Singapore, Sweden, the UK, Brazil and USA. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund and more than a dozen European banks have divested from Elbit Systems. Take action: - Sign the call for a military embargo on Israel - Call on UK bank Barclays  and on pension funds to divest from Elbit Systems 5. Israeli banks (including Hapoalim and Leumi) Israel’s private banks provide the financial infrastructure for all activities of companies, military bodies, governmental agencies and individuals in the continuing occupation of Palestinian and Syrian territory and provide significant financing to the construction of illegal Israeli settlements and the on-going colonisation of Palestinian land. Israeli banks have severed their contractual connections with the Palestinian banks in Gaza and stopped providing any and all services to them. Given the way in which the Palestinian economy is dominated by and dependent on the Israeli economy, this had a devastating impact on the local Gazan economy. A number of European pension funds including Dutch pension giant PGGM , the Luxembourg sovereign wealth fund and Denmark’s biggest bank  Danske Bank have already divested from Israeli banks. Take Action: - Send a Tweet to Dutch Pension giant ABP calling on them to divest from Israeli banks that fund the Israel occupation and settlements - Campaign for your own pension fund or any institution you are a part of to divest from Israeli banks. Get in touch for ideas on how to get started. 6. G4S G4S is a British security company that provides a wide range of equipment and services to the Israeli government and military including to Israeli checkpoints and to prisons where Palestinians, including many children, are held without trial and subjected to torture . G4S provides  equipment used in Israeli-run checkpoints at the Erez crossing between occupied Gaza and Israel, thereby directly assisting Israel’s siege on Gaza. The international campaign against G4S has cost the company millions of dollars in contracts with universities, charities and other public bodies and has seen the Bill Gates Foundation, the United Methodist Church and others divest from the company. In response, G4S has recently claimed that it will end some aspects of its role in Israeli apartheid and has stated it intends to end its role in Israel’s prisons by 2017, yet the campaign against the company must continue until its complicity in Israeli apartheid verifiably comes to a complete end. Take action: - Add your name to the open letter calling on G4S to end its support for Israeli apartheid and colonialism - Campaign for your G4S to be excluded from public contracts.  Get in touch  for ideas on how to get started. 7. Mekorot Mekorot is Israel’s national water company and illegally appropriates Palestinian water, diverting it to illegal Israeli settlements and towns inside Israel, and imposes severe obstacles to Palestinians accessing their own water. Mekorot is part of the Israeli occupation complex that denies Palestinians access to their fair share of aquifers that should be shared between Israel and Gaza. Palestinian and international organisations in Gaza are warning that Gaza’s water crisis is being rapidly escalated by the on-going assault on Gaza. Mekorot is now seeking to export its discriminatory water practises and is bidding to take over water supplies all across the world as they are being privatised. Authorities in Argentina, Netherlands and Portugal have cancelled cooperation deals with Mekorot following BDS pressure. Take action: - Share this fact sheet on Mekorot - Campaign for Mekorot to be excluded from local authority contracts.

To start out with an easier experience, rail-trails provide a relatively level and smoother pathway that is likely to have amenities along the way. The Great Allegheny Passage and the C&O Canal Towpath (together known as the COGAP), stretching from Pittsburgh to Washington, D.C., is a great rail-trail option that features a multitude of scenic stops along its 335 miles, plus convenient transportation at either end by rail or air. The Rails-to-Trails Conservancy has information on many more such routes. Perhaps the granddaddy of all bikepacking routes is the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route, stretching 2,745 miles from Banff, Alberta, Canada, to Antelope Wells, New Mexico, and encompassing all kinds of surfaces and weather conditions—plus spectacular scenery. Searching out state and national parks is another good way to find likely areas. (But, keep in mind, you’ll have to avoid riding on those trails designated for hikers only.)

I have never been afraid to express my opinion.  I welcome reasonable discussions and debate about almost anything—food, movies, books, baseball, politics, world affairs, religion, you name it.  I have strong feelings about almost anything and everything, and I usually am not at all hesitant to say what I am thinking.  I like to think that I listen to what others have to say and that I try and be informed about as much as I can before formulating my own opinion.  My values have not changed much at all in the course of my life, so I know my starting point based on those values, but my mind has been changed many times on many issues by listening and reading what others have to say. But this time I am lost.  I am Jewish, I am proud to be Jewish, and I feel a strong emotional tie to Israel and Jewish people everywhere.  I’ve only visited Israel once, back in 1997, and it left an indelible mark upon me.  I felt a connection historically and spiritually to the place.  I cried when we left in a way that was far different from the sadness I always feel when a trip or vacation ends.  Israel felt like home to me in a way I never expected.  From my research I now know I have family in Israel.  I have friends in Israel. I know how important Israel is to the past, the present, and the future of the Jewish people. I am also a lifelong progressive liberal (and not ashamed at all of that word) who argued and protested against every US war during my lifetime—from Vietnam starting in 1965 when I was a teenager up through Bush’s invasion of Iraq in 2002.  I know that some wars were so-called just wars; defeating Hitler and others who have tried to commit genocide is justified and necessary.  Dropping an atomic bomb on Japan , however, is not something I would have agreed with, if I’d been born at the time.  I don’t agree with capital punishment, even when the convicted person has committed a heinous crime.  I just don’t see killing as a way of accomplishing anything unless and until there is no choice in the name of self-defense or defense of others. So I have read the news these last few weeks with my stomach churning, my heart breaking, and my brain torn from one side to the other.  Almost everything I have read is filled with one-sided rhetoric. There is no reason for me to recap the arguments; you’ve heard them all before.  People who are defending Israel point me to pro-Israel sources; people who are anti-Israel point me to anti-Israel sources.  I read the New York Times every day, hoping it is more objective than other sources.  People who are pro-Israel say that the Times is biased against Israel; people who are anti-Israel say the Times is biased in favor of Israel. There are only a few actual facts: Hamas wants to destroy Israel—it says so in its charter ; there is a blockade around Gaza that makes escape for those who live there almost impossible and life there absolutely miserable; Hamas is building tunnels and accumulating weapons and shooting rockets to reach its goal of destroying Israel; Israel is fighting back with stronger and bigger weapons and with a defense system that has resulted in many more Palestinian deaths than Hamas has been able to inflict on Israel; Hamas refuses to agree to a ceasefire; Israel refuses to stop building new settlements; Hamas continues to shoot rockets, knowing that its own people will be killed in greater numbers; Israel knows that it cannot avoid killing them when it shoots its rockets at Gaza.  Neither side can win unless it obliterates the other side, in which case neither side has won. Meanwhile, people are dying on both sides, no one feels safe, and there is hate being spewed by both sides.  And across the world, there are people protesting, saying things that I’ve not heard said so publicly and proudly in my lifetime: “Death to the Jews, Kill the Jews.”  In one town in France , shop windows were smashed.  Immediately I thought of Kristallnacht . So why have I remained quiet?   Being quiet did not help the Jews in the 1930s. But why express my feelings when they only provoke more rhetoric?  Why be accused of being either a self-hating Jew for having sympathy for the people in Gaza or of being a Jewish imperialist/Zionist for understanding why Israel feels a need to use force to stop Hamas from trying to kill the Israeli people and their country? The dialogue is pointless.  No one really listens.  They just argue.  They just throw around words of hate.  They just make me feel sick and sad and confused. I have also remained quiet because I am confused and upset and heart-sick.  I see no hope for any improvement in the situation; I only see things getting worse.  I only see a terrible ending to all this anger and killing and hate, and it makes me despair for my children and my grandchildren, for Jews and for non-Jews, for our world, our planet, our lives.  There is no right, no wrong.  There is just ugliness, blood, violence, and hatred.  There are no words.  I have no words.  I am speechless.  I am silenced. Please don’t tell me what you think.  Please don’t fill my heart with more hate, with more anger. I’ve heard all the arguments. The rhetoric is all noise to me. Endless Facebook postings prove nothing; people only read what supports their point of view. There is nothing to celebrate. Everyone is wrong; everyone is right. Everyone needs to be quiet, to stop talking, and to start listening to their hearts, hoping with their souls, and thinking with their brains.  If those of us who do not live where the bombs are flying cannot talk to each other with respect and understanding, how is there any hope that there will ever be peace over there or, for that matter, anywhere? So my silence does not signify indifference or apathy; it signifies confusion and a willingness to listen and think and hope. You cannot listen when you are talking.  You cannot think when you are just spewing rhetoric.  You cannot hope when you are angry.  I am listening.  I am thinking.  I am trying as hard as I can to hope.

The law offers some protections to children who decide to work, such as parents being required to supervise those between 10 and twelve. Also, those under 12 are not allowed to work for third party employers and they must all still attend school while working. The Guardian headline is predictably overly dramatic, reading: “Bolivia’s child labor law shames us all.” But the real people who ought to be ashamed are the author of the piece and the editor who approved it. From the piece: Without a proscription on  child labour , the limits on what is permissible are likely to become blurred and then extended. It is not fanciful to worry that this law could lead to a greater regional acceptance of child labour, making it harder to eradicate. But Bolivia is not an isolated example. Since 2005, the number of child slaves remains at about 5.5 million. This suggests that many of the most difficult and entrenched manifestations of child exploitation have not been addressed. Of course, it’s a short leap from having a job working for your parents… to full blown slavery! Predictably there are very little unbiased resources which detail the struggle of Bolivians to implement this law. However, one voice did speak out clearly for economic freedom in his own country. Carlos Cachari Ticona, 12, is the leader of Bolivia’s Union of Child and Adolescent Workers and was an important voice in passing the legislation that would allow children the freedom of choice. His group, UNATSBO, were pepper sprayed while protesting in support of the law outside of the presidential palace. President Evo Morales sympathized with the young people who were desperate to help supplement the income of their impoverished families. Morales stated that he believed that child labor was a necessity born of poverty, but that it can also help build a social conscience. President Morales was said to have worked many odd jobs as a child, harvesting sugarcane and selling ice cream amongst other things. While some would cry out “sweatshops,” the reality is far different. Many young people in Bolivia go to work doing things such as shining shoes, selling trinkets or collecting bus fares. These are good jobs that are not dangerous and can build character while supplementing the income of poor to middle income families who may rely heavily on the extra money. It’s poor form for governments to outlaw this kind of work, simply because of the emotional arguments against the possibility of “child exploitation.” Marxist sociologist James Petras heavily opposed the measure. He accused President Morales of trying to create a “reserve army” of exploited children who will depress wages and replace militant adults in the labor force. The Director of Anti-Slavery International wrote Morales a similarly strongly-worded letter , saying: “… reduction in minimum age would only accentuate the chances of the children of your country being more susceptible to trafficking, slavery, servitude, forced labour and violence. Still, not everyone in Bolivia is so convinced that children are about to become slaves. Rodrigo Medrano Calle is a Bolivian labor leader who argues that his constituents (he is 14-years-old) deserve the right to work. ”I started working when I was nine, and I’ve done everything, shining shoes, bus driver’s assistant, selling. I’ve gone through most of the jobs common for child and adolescent workers,” said Rodrigo, making $6-$7 for a night’s work. “I lived on the street for a time and was going in the wrong direction, but then I found the movement, and it gave me a reason to be. I’m going to fight for my  compañeros’  rights, not just my own.” An adult counselor for UNATSBO,  Luz Rivera Daza , argues that it is better for child workers to be legal, so they at least have some protections when they are working, rather than to do so illegally. ”If you have to work, then you have to work exploited,” she said . “This just makes you more vulnerable.” “Why should there be a minimum age if the work is voluntary?” Rodrigo asked. “The work of a child or adolescent is not bad – it helps society, it helps a family, and it helps us grow as people.” Austin Petersen is the Editor in Chief of The Libertarian Republic as well as CEO of Stonegait LLC.

It lowers mortality among women and infants, improves educational outcomes, and slows population growth. It also makes it easier for women to enter the workforce, which acts as an economic booster shot even in wealthy nations such as Japan. But the costs and complications of effective contraception can be hard for poor families to manage, especially in cultures where husbands may not approve of their wives controlling their reproductive choices. But these economic, logistical, and even cultural problems may have a design solution: The “Sayana press” is a combination of Pfizer’s injectable contraceptive Depo-Provera and the Uniject, a special combination syringe and medicine storage device developed over the last two decades to help vaccine distribution in poor countries. Tap to expand image Nikhil Sonnad The device itself solves a number of problems: It makes delivery more effective because it is smaller than traditional syringes. There is never a mismatch between the number of syringes and the number of doses available. And because Depo-Provera is injected just underneath the skin, only simple training is needed for a health worker to administer a shot—in fact, the project’s backers hope that women will someday be able to simply inject themselves. Depo-Provera provides three months of effective contraception with each shot, which also makes it easier for women to manage than daily pills. Another health problem Uniject fights is the reuse of syringes, which is all too common in poorer countries and spreads disease, with HIV/AIDS among the most serious threats. After a Uniject is used once, a teeny flap valve in the neck prevents the blister from being re-inflated, refilled and re-used. This device was developed by PATH, a non-profit that works with companies to develop effective health technology for developing countries, beginning in the late 1980s. By the late 1990s, it had partnered with BD, the medical device maker, to manufacture them on a grand scale, and since 2000, 88 million have been used to deliver vaccines in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

Fittingly, the final example was a bright white R/T Plus 100 th Anniversary Edition and oh yeah, it’s got a HEMI® engine, but it will also deliver the kind of fuel economy owners of 1970 Challenger R/Ts could only dream of! Special permanently affixed metal badges forever identify it as the final 2014 Challenger built as the Brampton facility is converted for output of the updated and improved 2015 Challenger lineup.   Most impressive, this final Challenger was the 280,783rd built at Brampton since Dodge re-entered the Detroit pony car wars in 2008 with the limited production (7,219 built) Challenger SRT8. The very first regular production 2008 Challenger SRT8 rolled off the Brampton line on Thursday, May 8, 2008, some 2,236 calendar days earlier. It was the answer to the dreams and requests of Dodge fans all over the world for a modern pony car contender to pick up where the 1970 – 1974 Challenger (E-Body) left off.     It all seemed too good to be true! But it was real. Only three colors were offered, Brilliant Black, Bright Silver and HEMI Orange, and all were equipped with the mighty 425 horsepower 6.1 liter HEMI engine backed by a five-speed automatic transmission. As such, enthusiasts clamored to get theirs before the program ended.   Happily, the successful 2008 Challenger SRT8 program blossomed into a regular production offering with Challengers built for a variety of budgets. For 2009 and beyond, the Challenger was available with a full range of popular colors, options and models ranging from the sporty and economical V-6 powered SE and SXT to the 5.7-liter HEMI-powered R/T. At the top of the line, the SRT8 held court with as much as 470 horsepower and an available six-speed Pistol Grip shifter (added in 2009).   Along the way, several limited production special edition Challengers fanned the flames and included the LC22R Drag Pack program where you could buy a semi-completed NHRA drag racer right from the Mopar parts counter at your local Dodge dealer! The 2010 Mopar ’10 Challenger R/T was another hit with metallic pearl black, special stripes, cold air induction and final assembly handled by the Mopar Upfit Center in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. From the basic 306 horsepower V-6 SXT coupe to the Viper-powered 2011 LC22R V-10 Drag Pak to the re-introduction of the legendary HEMI ‘Shaker’ (the rebirth of a muscle car icon with cold air induction), every Challenger delivered a fun driving experience.     So as we bid farewell to the last 2014 LC Challenger built, let’s reflect on the happy fact that Dodge’s heritage-inspired pony car has been a huge success. Consider this: total production of the original 1970 – 1974 Dodge Challenger (E-Body) was 165,437 cars. In the 2,237 calendar days since the Brampton, Ontario, plant has been building 2008 – 2014 LC-series Challengers, a total of 280,783 have been completed and shipped to Dodge dealers all over North America. In other words, for every “classic” 1970 – 1974 Challenger built, nearly two modern Challengers have been sold!   But while the original E-body Challenger survived only five model years (1970–1974), the modern edition has been available for seven seasons (2008–2014) and is still going strong. In fact, the 2015 Challenger is looking to be even more popular than ever. The incorporation of 1971-inspired exterior and interior styling themes has stayed true to its roots while evolving into a modern day muscle car. Add in the available Shaker hood, the R/T Scat Pack with potent 6.4-liter HEMI engine’s 485 horsepower or the SRT HEMI Hellcat engine’s with an earth shattering 707 horsepower, and the Challenger’s future looks brighter than ever! Here’s to another decade of challenging the Detroit pony car establishment — and winning. Long live the Dodge Challenger!   —Steve Magnante    ", "score"=>157.59547, "summaryTitle"=>"2014 Dodge Challenger: The End of the Line Is a New Beginning - The Official Blog of Dodge", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"On Tuesday, June 24, 2014, the last 2014 Dodge Challenger rolled off the Brampton, Ontario, assembly line.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://blog.dodge.com/vehicles/2014-dodge-challenger-end-line-new-beginning/", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1qE63KI", "lastseen"=>"20140726004447", "page"=>"http://blog.dodge.com/vehicles/2014-dodge-challenger-end-line-new-beginning/", "ogtitle"=>"2014 Dodge Challenger: The End of the Line Is a New Beginning - The Official Blog of Dodge"}, {"domain"=>"chow.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406330348000", "h3"=>"Related Recipe Gallery", "site"=>"www.chow.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004102", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335262564", "title"=>"Slushy Strawberry Vodka Lemonade Recipe - CHOW", "initial"=>"20140725231908", "summaryText"=>"This blended mix of lemon juice, simple syrup, fresh strawberries, ice, and vodka refreshes like a 7-Eleven Slurpee for grownups.

The venomous bites usually heal well if left alone, said Dr. Donna Seger, medical director of the Tennessee Poison Center. However, she warned that people can react differently to the bites. A lesion accompanied by a fever, rash and muscle pain can be life-threatening, especially in children, she said. The bites can cause hemolysis, a breakdown in red blood cells. \"Our recommendations are that all children under 12 with a brown recluse spider bite should have a urine test for the presence of hemoglobin in blood which indicates hemolysis,\" Seger said. But adults who are bitten without suffering a rash, fever or muscle pain do not need the urine test, she advised. Ointments don't usually help, she said. \"As physicians, it is hard for us to do nothing,\" Seger said. \"The lesion has classic characteristics, but if physicians are not familiar with this bite, the tendency is to debride and cut out the lesion. This actually slows the healing process and can result in disfigurement that would not occur if the lesion were left alone.\" She said ice works better than drugs to treat the pain from a bite. In homes, the spider can be found in darkened storage areas, such as closets, garages, basements, attics and cupboards. People can avoid the potential for bites by moving beds away from curtains or walls, according to a fact sheet on the spider from the University of Tennessee Extension Service.

Of course you guys know I'm James in real life.\" James then told fans that he would wait for their opinion before going ahead with it. He added: \"I'll leave it with you guys. Your opinion is important to me x.\" After winning X Factor , James went on to achieve a number one hit with 'Impossible'. His debut album hit number two in the charts and spawned the singles 'You're Nobody 'Til Somebody Loves You' and 'Recovery'. He also kicked off his first UK and European headline tour earlier this year. Despite his success, James also faced backlash late last year following a number of high-profile spats on Twitter, with the likes of One Direction, Matt Cardle and Frankie Boyle. This heightened after James made a homophobic slur in a rap song, which he later apologised for. In June, James confirmed his departure from Simon Cowell's record label Syco , following months of speculation. James has yet to sign with another record label, but he revealed to a fan via Twitter this week (22 July): \"I'm not going independent.. I'm meeting with labels in august and I'm very excited about it.\" This week, James also denied reports that he was going to take part in this year's Celebrity Big Brother , but claimed he turned down a \"life changing amount of money\" to enter.

Okay, maybe two cold beers. But sometimes the unthinkable happens: someone drank all of your chilled beer (it was probably you) and the only ones left are warm. Don't panic, because we've got plenty of ideas for how to bring down the temperature of your bottle or can and make it quaffable ASAP. Here are five kitchen hacks for cooling beer quickly, including a trick that takes less than 30 seconds. Beer Cooling Method # 1: Submerge the beer bottle or can in a bucket or large pot filled with ice water and salt. The salt lowers the freezing temperature of the mixture of ice and water, causing the ice to melt, which lowers the water's temperature and chills the beer faster. Chilling time: About 15 minutes Beer Cooling Method #2: Wrap the beer bottle or can in a damp cloth or paper towel, then place it in the freezer. As the water on the cloth or towel evaporates, it draws heat away from the beer, cooling it faster. Chilling time: About 15 minutes Beer Cooling Method #3: Attach a SpinChill ($30) beer chilling device to the top of your beer bottle or can. Submerge the beer in a bucket or large pot filled with ice water and salt. Activate the device and it will rotate the beer in the ice water without creating additional carbonation. According to SpinChill, spinning adds convection which drastically increases heat transfer between the hot liquid and cold ice. Chilling time: Under 5 minutes Beer Cooling Method #4: Drill a hole in the top of a thermos cap. Securely fasten a long screw into the hole using two bolts. Attach the screw to a power drill. Submerge a beer can in a pitcher filled with ice water and salt. Place the thermos cap over the beer and activate the drill. The beer will rotate quickly and its spinning motion increases the rate of heat transfer and causes the beer to cool more quickly. Chilling time: About 5 minutes Beer Cooling Method #5: Hold a bottle of compressed air upside down and spray the side of a beer bottle or can for a few seconds until frost forms. Holding the can upside down is key because it makes the air that comes out extra cold. Chilling time: About 30 seconds What's your go-to method for cooling beer quickly?

This time it includes data about Enhanced Campaigns, Facebook's earnings, analytics tools, Christmas, data privacy and the thorny relationship between CIOs and CMOs. For more of this type of thing, download the Econsultancy Internet Statistics Compendium ... Enhanced Campaigns a year on A year after the switch to Enhanced Campaigns for Google paid search a new Kenshoo survey of 85 paid search marketers gives a useful snapshot of the industry . A large majority (83%) of respondents stating that they now bundle their desktop and mobile search budgets together rather than viewing them separately. It also shows that just over half of respondents (53%) still spend 20% or less of their total paid search budget on mobile. This is likely to be impacted by lower CPCs on mobile, but also due to the fact that marketers still find that desktop delivers a greater ROI. Almost two-thirds (64%) of respondents stated that mobile paid search campaigns perform worse than desktop. How would you rate the performance of your mobile paid search efforts when compared to desktop?   Facebook Q2 earnings Facebook's Q2 results show that total revenue was $2.9bn, an increase of 61% compared with $1.8bn in the second quarter of 2013.  Total advertising revenue was $2.68bn, a 67% increase from the same quarter last year.  Mobile advertising revenue grew 151% and was 62% of total ad revenue. Total payments and other fees revenue was $234m in Q2. Looking at its user figures, daily active users were 829m as of June 30 2014, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Mobile monthly users were 1.07bn, an increase of 31% year-over-year, while daily users on mobile were 654m on average for June 2014, an increase of 39% year-over-year. Facebook's 20% text limit dropped? When promoting a post on Facebook marketers are supposed to be restricted to a limit of 20% text in the post's image. Econsultancy contributor Jeff Rajeck has evidence to suggest this has changed after successfully uploading images with 50% text coverage. Read his article to find out more .    Which analytics tools do marketers use? In the past digital analytics mainly focused on desktop activity, but now businesses have to employ a broader range of analytics products to measure activity across relatively new channels such as mobile and social.  The new Econsultancy/Lynchpin Measurement and Analytics Report examines the extent to which different analytics tool are used by surveying more than 1,000 digital professionals. Web analytics predictably came out as the most widely used (36%) followed by Excel (90%). Two-thirds of respondents (65%) use some form of social analytics while 27% are ‘planning to use’ them, which is indicative of the fact that businesses see value in social media interactions but are still getting to grips with how to measure the ROI. Which data-related tools or types of technology do you use? It's never too early to start planning for Christmas Data from eBay.co.uk shows that there were more than 2.7m searches that included the word 'Christmas' in August 2013. However we've got a few months until it really kicks off, as searches for Christmas-related items in the home, furniture and DIY category started in earnest in September 2013 – the same time that there was an increase in searches for toys and games.  Both categories saw a doubling of searches compared to August, before hitting their peak in November. Divide between CMOs and CIOs narrows New research from Accenture shows that CMOs and CIOs are working more collaboratively than ever before . Based on a survey of more than 1,100 senior marketing and IT executives, the data shows that 43% of marketers and 50% of IT leaders think their relationship with the other has improved over the past year.  Also, nearly one-quarter (23%) of respondents believe collaboration between the two teams is currently at the right level, up from 10% last year. However 40% of CMOs believe their company’s IT team doesn’t understand the urgency of integrating new data sources into campaigns to address market conditions. And 43% of CMOs said that the technology development process is too slow for the speed required for digital marketing. Shift in attitudes to data privacy? New research released today by Webtrends shows that more than half of Britons (58%) say they’re not concerned about the amount of data they share with brands.  18-24 year olds are least concerned – 68% believe the amount they share is currently about right or are not bothered about it, followed by 64% of 25-34 year olds.  However consumers aged 55 and over are much more cautious, with half objecting to sharing data with brands completely. The results come from a survey of 2,000 British consumers aged 18 or over. The era of data-driven marketing And finally, here is a neat infographic that summarises some more of the findings from our recent Measurement and Analytics Report which was published in association with Lynchpin.

I had the pleasure of interviewing our CEO and Chairman, Jim Weiss , about the culture of W2O Group to help employees not only get to know a little more about Jim, but also for them to truly understand his vision for the company. Enjoy! If you could describe the culture of W2O Group in 3 words, what would you say? I would say pivot, perseverance, and entrepreneurialism. Each of these words embodies more descriptors like being open to learning and risk taking. It’s about liking the unknown and being comfortable with it, rather than with the known. It’s a commitment to quality, meticulousness, preciseness, and a dedication to innovation. W2O Group is about the pragmatic disruption – we don’t want to be a part of it, but we understand it’s reality, so we want to disrupt it in a way that makes sense in a business. This is not a flakey or unserious culture; it’s a serious and down to business culture. What does it take for someone to be successful here? Never say die – it’s all about perseverance. A successful person in this company is someone who does what they say they are going to do – they make things happen. Those who are successful here are direct, results orientated, analytical, but not in a way that doesn’t allow you to make it happen, risk takers and smart. These are people with real integrity and authenticity. What’s the most difficult decision you’ve made as a CEO? The most difficult decision I’ve made was the decision to grow. It was when I realized I was going to have to open the New York office and take my name off the door to invite others in. There are always other difficult decisions that are around clients, but growing was a tough decision for me personally. What are some of the ways the agency is looking to evolve? We want to evolve technologically, both internally and externally. We want to be leveraging, expanding, and developing more applicable technology. We want to be working off the most advanced platforms and be more operational. Finally, we want to evolve globally and in multiple languages.

In a slow-burning 40-minute team bosses’ news conference at the end of the same day in which A zerbaijan announced they would join the calendar from 2016 , Red Bull chief Horner grew irritated with the line of questioning taken by the international media towards the six principals present. After fielding a growing number of political questions surrounding F1’s trips to Russia in October and Azerbaijan in two years, along with the sport’s finances, Horner took issue with why the teams were being put on the spot over such issues when it was up to the FIA to decide where they race. Becoming increasingly forthright during the course of his answer to one such question, Horner said: “This is becoming a very depressing press conference when we’re only focusing on the negativities. “Look, there’s a calendar that comes out in October and November. We all have a choice whether we enter the World Championship or not. All the people sitting here are racers and they’re here because they are passionate about the sport and they want to compete. “When we sign up for that championship we put our faith and trust in the promoter and the FIA and we will attend those races unless they deem it unnecessary for us to be there. “All of you, or the vast majority of you [journalists], will be at those races. Why? You are either passionate about the sport or because you earn a living out of covering the sport and I think it’s wrong to make Formula 1 a political statement or subject when we’re a sport.” Anna Woolhouse is joined by former F1 driver David Brabham and F1 Racing magazine Columnist Peter Windsor to discuss all the fallout from the German Grand Following a start to the 2014 season which was dominated by debate and criticism over F1’s new quieter engines and more energy-efficient technology, Horner’s Mercedes counterpart Toto Wolff remarked at a recent team principals’ conference that he didn’t know of a sport which criticised itself as much as F1. Adopting a similar theme, Horner argued that more attention should be focused on the recent quality of racing with the political controversies directed to the FIA and Bernie Ecclestone instead. “We should be talking about the drivers in these conferences, we should be talking about the spectacular racing that happened between our drivers and his [Ferrari boss Marco Mattiacci’s] driver at the last grand prix. We should be talking about what a great race it was for Lewis Hamilton to come through the grid, yet all we do is focus on the negatives. “It has to be said it gets pretty boring for us to sit up here and field these questions off. So how about asking some questions about what’s going to happen in the race on Sunday, what’s going to happen in qualifying because if you’ve got these questions [about politics] please point them at Mr Todt or Mr Ecclestone rather than the teams.” With the tension suitably raised in the room, Horner’s pointed request was immediately heeded as the next, and final, question of proceedings focused on the rather less contentious issue of race-day tyre wear at the Hungaroring.

Montanans are,", "content"=>"Follow us on Twitter! Like us on Facebook! The phrase \" A rising tide lifts all boats \" captures Montana’s legacy of using our collective power of perseverance and determination to affect greater change through ingenuity and innovation. Montanans are, and always have been, pioneers on the frontier of change. As Montana vies to recruit new businesses, our success stories must be told to ensure prospective companies realize the untapped opportunities available in Butte and Montana. The Orphan Girl   is a multi-platform film, produced by Chisel Industries ,  Headframe Spirits , and the  Montana Film Office   designed to bring national awareness to Butte and Montanaand support business recruitment. Nearly 150 years ago, Alexander Graham bell invented the telephone and Edison the lightbulb.  Suddenly, a network of wires wove its way across America.  A thousand miles of electric signals, humming with energy, lighting streets and carrying messages, all made possible by copper.  This copper came from Butte, America. The Industrial Revolution Had Begun.  From around the world, 90,000 immigrants arrived on American shores, eager for a new beginning. They arrived in Butte and built their homes into the hillside. Each day, armed with picks, dynamite and raw effort, these immigrants unearthed the copper that connected the world. Every day thousands of men descended into 10,000 miles of hand-carved underground passageways. Butte, Montana was a frontier and to it migrated the industrious mavericks, pioneers, and trailblazers who built it - the epicenter of innovation.They uncovered the Richest Hill on Earth. And now Butte has even more potential in the 21st century. Each day the sun rises, our hero miner reflects that this day might be his last.  The sacrifices and hardships the miners face every day underground, are a bold reality. Yet, the perseverance of these mavericks fueled the American industrial revolution from 5,000 feet inside the earth. The Orphan Girl’s story melds the legacy, heritage, and innovation of Butte’s past, with the future of what is shaping to be a second wave of entrepreneurial enterprise. Butte's pioneer spirit has been rekindled today, and this project is helping to bridge that gap. The second lightbulb in history (after Edison's) was lit in Butte, and this western town had electricity before New York City and Paris. In 1917, Butte was the largest city west of St Louis. Stars from Mark Twain, Bing Crosby, and Charlie Chaplin to Clark Gable all performed in Butte.    Ireland's affinity for Butte, MT is exceptional, and the appreciation for opportunities Butte provided the famine stricken Irish immigrants is long lived. When other cities of the west displayed signs that read \" Irish Need Not Apply \" the Copper City opened its arms. Similar to her industrial sister cities Cleveland, Detroit, and Pittsburgh, Butte’s industrial boom went bust and blight emerged.  Butte was left with a town full of decrepit, boarded up buildings.  Butte was a city built for 100,000 and many made fortunes mining the earth.  As mining played out, Butte’s economy was devastated, resulting in massive population decline.  After 1950, 70% of the city’s population moved away and the historic Uptown’s built environment suffered from vacancy and disinvestment. However there’s a newfound hope in Butte, and it's led by modern mavericks on a still wild frontier, boldly trailblazing a brighter future.  Like the generation that came before, Butte remains a city of maverick pioneers and innovators, and the film’s end and closing credits sets the stage to tell this story.   The stories of present-day innovators will be featured on screen. The Orphan Girl   short film is one component of “ The Spirit of Butte ,” a broader campaign strategy to increase national awareness for Butte, and tell the stories of modern Montana success stories by profiling Montana’s innovators.The initiative will develop an online series accessed through the web portal, #BUTTEinnovates with vignettes profiling the “Legends of Butte” and present day innovators called “Modern Mavericks.” The crew is made up of nearly all Montanans, and shot entirely on location in Butte, Montana.  As Montana raised storytellers, we’re a team committed to producing a high quality film series that encapsulates the characters and essence of Butte.  This shall be achieved by hiring a cast and crew of Montanans; sourcing accommodations and foods from Montana businesses; and renting equipment from Montana companies. The Orphan Girl’s economic impact to date surpasses $200K. This film is being co-produced by Montana’s Entrepreneurs of the Year, and owners of  Headframe Spirits , John and Courtney McKee.  John and Courtney are active participants of economic development in Butte, and hold great responsibility in giving back to their community.  Four years ago they started their business and named it  Headframe Spirits  in honor of Butte's historical past.  They now operate 2 distilleries in Butte, with plans to break ground on the 3rd in 2015, making Headframe the largest distillery west of the Mississippi and providing hundreds of job opportunities to the Butte community.  In 2013 and 2014,  Headframe Spirits  made a $10,000 donation to the  Montana Folk Festival , a free festival, featuring a variety of musical acts from around the world, which takes place in Butte.  By sharing Butte’s untold story from a perspective that is compelling to our community and the world, this project will provide job opportunities and economic development opportunities and bolster tourism in Butte while creating national and international interest in the area.   Butte is a spectacular setting for film and for business. Montana ranked #5 Nationally for cost of doing business, and is in the top 10 for infrastructure and quality of life (CNBC, 2013).  In Butte, the cost of real estate is well below the national and state averages. For example, a three or four story historic building can be purchased for $100K. If you’re interested in Butte, incentives for relocating your business to Montana’s entrepreneurial epicenter, contact  INNOVATE MONTANA , MERDI , and the  BLDC . The Orphan Girl stars Butte native, Brick \"Prigge\" Patrick , now a working actor in Los Angeles, Butte natives Zac Thomas, Ken Bates, and Tom Malloy, Andrew Rizzo, Joel Lavold, Travis Beagley, Kendra Mylnechuck, Gary Henderson, Lou Morris, and dozens of extras from Butte.   The film is directed by Montana native Yarrow Kraner , who has directed projects for Virgin, Richard Branson, Warner Brothers, TNT network & The Rock, Columbia Records, The University of Montana, Montana State University, Montana Tourism, and more, and his work has been honored with several National and International awards. The Cinematographer is Logan Triplett , a Montana born prodigy, now working in Los Angeles who has lensed work for Leica, Vans, Sitka, Oracle, and other highly visible projects. A seasoned team of editors are currently working on post-production: Andy George (also directed Behind the Scenes), Ben McManus (also co-creative director), and John Sweeney (also Director of Photography 2nd Unit). The film's Producer is Matthew Barbour, and rounding out the key production team is Allison Whitmer (UPM), Tyler Boylan (1st AD), Lindsay Minnich (Art Director), Brianna Murphy (wardrobe), Sheena Nicolay (Hair & Makeup), Heidi Dubose (Sound), Bob Bryan (Gaffer), Andrew Thie (Key Grip), Blaine Dunkley (2nd Unit), Cassandra Sunell (Production Coordinator and social media), Maria Phelps (Social media), and Butte native Brian Skuletich (Associate Producer). The Orphan Girl will be scored by celebrated virtuoso composer  Philip Sheppard , who has scored over a twenty-five films , has been featured at Sundance, and collaborated with musicians Jeff Buckley, Pretty Lights, UNKLE, David Bowie and Suzanne Vega.  Sheppard is a professor at the Royal Academy of Music, and scored and recorded arrangements for the world's 205 national anthems for the 2012 Olympics.   In addition, just recently, Sheppard led the orchestra and chorus of  Opera North  at the opening ceremony of the  2014 Tour de France . Philip is also on the Board of Advisors of HATCH , a Montana-based non-profit to mentor creativity and innovation, founded by Yarrow Kraner, which is where he and Yarrow first met.  Listen to some of Philip's  MUSIC HERE . The premiere of \"The Orphan Girl\" is September 11, 2014 at the Motherlode Theatre / The Orphan Girl Theatre in Butte.   And boy do we have some surprises in store for you.  Secret musical acts, bonus featurettes, behind the scenes videos, prize raffles, random door prizes, and of course - the after party.  Imagine seeing your name up on screen, or introducing the actors for Q&A...  A little support goes a long way - and whether you're able to make it Butte for the premiere or not, is irrelevant.  You will have helped to forge into a permanent collection a film that tells the story of heroic Americans and a frontier city.  Thank you. Initial funding has come from  Headframe Spirits , and a grant from The  Montana Film Office . Principal photography and physical production / filming is 90% complete, and now the project must be completed.  Funds will be used to finance film completion, post-production, editing, distribution and festival submissions.  Distribution will be complemented by a robust social media strategy and development of online partnerships to gain audience and exposure. In the event that we exceed our goal, remaining funds will be used to further market Butte by increasing exposure and awareness through non-traditional channels.  These channels include submissions to international festivals, online content showcasing modern innovators, and early development of a feature film, with Butte as the backdrop.

Catherine, who asked to use only her", "content"=>"A Calgary woman says she was shocked to learn of a policy at the city’s only fertility treatment centre that restricts patients from using sperm, eggs or embryos from donors who do not match their ethnic background. Catherine, who asked to use only her first name, said she sought invitro fertilization at the Regional Fertility Program last March as a single woman. During routine consultations with her doctor she was told she could only use sperm from donors who were white, like her. “That’s when everything went downhill,” she told the Herald. “I was absolutely floored.” Dr. Calvin Greene, the clinic’s administrative director, confirmed the private facility will not treat couples or singles who insist on using donors of a different ethnicity. The policy has been in place since the clinic opened in the 1980s. “I’m not sure that we should be creating rainbow families just because some single woman decides that that’s what she wants,” he said. “That’s her prerogative, but that’s not her prerogative in our clinic.” A statement on the clinic’s website reads: “it is the practice of the Regional Fertility Program not to permit the use of a sperm donor that would result in a future child appearing racially different than the recipient or the recipient’s partner.” Greene said doctors at the clinic feel “a child of an ethnic background should have the ability to be able to identify with their ethnic roots.” He added patients should have a “cultural connection” to their donors. The Alberta Human Rights Commission upheld the policy after a white couple brought a complaint against the clinic about five years ago, Greene said. They were not infertile but had hoped to use non-Caucasian sperm. “Our psychologist evaluated them and really didn’t see why a couple that is not infertile should be choosing sperm donors they have no cultural relationship with.” Interracial couples treated at the clinic have the option of using donors that are ethnically similar to either one of the partners, he added, noting most patients want their children to resemble them. According to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta, doctors can refuse to provide non-emergency treatment on moral grounds as long as they refer patients to other doctors who will. However the Regional Fertility Program is the only fertility clinic in Calgary, so patients must go to Edmonton, Saskatoon, Vancouver or beyond if they don’t agree with its policy. Women receiving fertility treatment often need daily or very frequent treatments for a matter of months. Greene said the clinic’s policy follows similar guidelines used with in-province adoption and foster care, where children are placed with families of their same cultural background whenever possible. “I would ask you, why would you not choose somebody of your own cultural background?” Catherine said there are many reasons. By the time she narrowed down her pool of potential donors to those who met Canadian standards, had a good health history and a compatible blood type, she was left with only 20 or so Caucasian candidates to choose from. Many of them had already been used by several other patients in Calgary. “Frankly, it’s appalling how many people have the same donors, probably because of this policy,” she said. “A friend of mine just went through this process and used the donor that I would have picked.”", "score"=>157.3595, "summaryTitle"=>"No ‘rainbow families’: Ethnic donor stipulation at fertility centre ‘floors’ local woman", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"A Calgary woman says she was shocked to learn of a policy at the city&amp;#8217;s only fertility treatment", "cities"=>["ca-ab-calgary", "ca-ab-edmonton"], "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.calgaryherald.com/rainbow+families+Ethnic+donor+stipulation+fertility+centre+floors+local+woman/10063343/story.html", "referrer"=>["t.co", "direct", "twitterrific.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1rFwhdG", "lastseen"=>"20140726004250", "page"=>"http://www.calgaryherald.com/rainbow+families+ethnic+donor+stipulation+fertility+centre+floors+local+woman/10063343/story.html", "ogtitle"=>"No &amp;#8216;rainbow families&amp;#8217;: Ethnic donor stipulation at fertility centre &amp;#8216;floors&amp;#8217; local woman"}, {"domain"=>"newsnow.co.uk", "initial_epoch"=>"1406324553000", "site"=>"www.newsnow.co.uk", "lastindexed"=>"20140726003704", "keywords"=>"Dogs,Animals,Hot Topics", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335024338", "title"=>"NewsNow: Dogs News | Breaking News & Search 24/7 (years)", "initial"=>"20140725214233", "summaryText"=>"Teen gets 23 years for fatally shooting police dog Miami Herald   19:31 11-Jul-14  ", "content"=>"Teen gets 23 years for fatally shooting police dog Miami Herald   19:31 11-Jul-14  ", "score"=>157.35522, "summaryTitle"=>"Dogs » years Find Dogs ads under Pets & Animals on NewsNow Classifieds", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Read the latest Dogs headlines, on NewsNow: the one-stop shop for Dogs news", "cities"=>"gb", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.newsnow.co.uk/h/Hot+Topics/Animals/Dogs?JavaScript=1&searchheadlines=1&search=years", "referrer"=>["newsnow.net", "direct", "newsnow.co.uk", "bit.ly", "facebook.com", "t.co"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1qEpD9E", "lastseen"=>"20140726003654", "page"=>"http://www.newsnow.co.uk/h/hot+topics/animals/dogs"}, {"domain"=>"diabeticconnect.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406332835000", "h3"=>["Best Foods For Blood Sugar Control", "Explore", "Stay Informed"], "site"=>"www.diabeticconnect.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004739", "keywords"=>"diabetic connect,diabeticconnect,diabeticonnect,diabetes info,diabetes community,diabetes forum,diabetic recipes,type 2 diabetes,type 1 diabetes,diabetes support,symptoms of diabetes in women,do i have diabetes,what are symptoms of diabetes,diabetes awareness,how to avoid diabetes,how to reverse diabetes,can diabetes be cured,diabetes side effects,stevia diabetes,diabetes insulin,lada diabetes,what cause diabetes,medication for diabetes,how can you get diabetes,cures for diabetes,type 1 diabetes facts,type 2 diabetes facts,undiagnosed diabetes,diabetes mellitus 2,how do you treat diabetes", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335659244", "title"=>"Foods To Help Reduce Neuropathy Symptoms | Diabetic Connect", "initial"=>"20140726000035", "summaryText"=>"Are you concerned about the possible effects of diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage)?

While there is no denying the breadth of unbelievably effective beauty products throughout America, it is exciting to find international products and brands that appear to have been made especially for you. Illustrations by Rachael Yap . Follow her on Instagram at @raeraeyap I’ve already shared some of the hottest Korean beauty products to try – from face washes to lip treatments the options seem endless! Now I’m exploring another destination that is not only known for its breathtaking architecture, but also for its appreciation of natural beauty. Hello, Europe! We’ve all heard about French beauty and how time stands still for their women, but great skin and hair doesn’t stop when you leave Paris, so I’m sharing 5 European countries and a product from each that will spice up your skincare and hair routine and give you a taste for how Europe does beauty. FRANCE Avene Thermal Spring Water - Water plays an integral part into the health of your body and your skin. While you should be drinking your fair share daily, you can also hydrate your skin from the outside with Avene Thermal Water Spray . Made for all skin types, but especially beneficial for sensitive skin, the spray can be used as often as you like and helps soothe and soften irritated skin. You can also use it to set your makeup. This cult classic has a ton of other thermal water benefits and can come in a small travel side for an on-the-go spritz! CZECH REPUBLIC Manufacktura Beer Hair Shampoo - A beauty brand from the Czech Republic, Manufaktura products originally surprised me. The brand’s top products are made with elements from the Dead Sea, wine and beer. Crazy, right?! If you’re underage and can’t do this beer hair rinse , then Manufaktura Beer Hair Shampoo might just be for you. The product is loaded with grain extracts and other ingredients that promises shiny, stronger – and possibly even longer – locks. Manufaktura is not the first brand to offer beer cosmetics, but it might be the one with the purest ingredients. GERMANY Labello Lip Balm - I’m sure you have a favorite by now – it might be Rosebud Salve, Maybelline Baby Lips, or EOS Lip Balm, but there is always room for one more balm that truly moisturizes your lips. Especially because this time of year your pout might be a little parched from too much sun. Labello goes under Nivea in some countries but if you get the German product, the flavors and targeted benefits are plentiful. Fruit flavors, lip repair, chamomile…it doesn’t stop. But to test out this product, go classic – the original has a creamy consistency that many swear won’t disappoint. SWEDEN Sachajuan Hair Repair - To start, I love the packaging! It is minimalistic and chic, but that’s not the reason to try Sachajuan Hair Repair . It was voted by Elle as one of the best international beauty products last year, AND deep conditions treated tresses like no other. Sourced from a nutrient rich algae, apply after washing and leave on for 10 minutes then rinse. It will reduce frizz (great for those in humid environments) and intensify shine. This product could be your staple treatment for years to come thanks to the Swedes. IRELAND  Burren Perfumery Organic Rose Otto Face Cream - Now that your hair, lips and makeup are set, add this Rose Otto Face Cream to your routine for more hydration and nourishment. Made to help maturing, dry or sensitive skin this product is 78% organic and made of many of the amazing oils that deserve to be in your beauty routine. Burren Perfumery is a family-owned business and while located in Ireland, they use beautiful plants and oils from around the world to make their soaps and creams. This non-greasy cream is also lightly scented as not to irritate the nose. Have you used any European products you love? Let me know below, I would love to try them!  <3 Mish", "score"=>157.23497, "summaryTitle"=>"European Beauty: 5 Must-Try Products", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"All around the world beauty routines are different.

Lalu Pada Desember 2011 , Ashton Irwin bergabung dengan Luke Hemmings, Michael Clifford, dan Calum Hood dan menjadi drummer 5 Seconds of Summer. Lengkap sudah empat orang personel dari 5 Seconds of Summer. Sejak saat itu, band yang beranggotakan empat remaja ini mulai menarik perhatian pendengar musik, beberapa label musik besar, dan telah menandatangani kesepakatan dengan Sony ATV Music Publishing. Meskipun pada saat itu mereka samasekali tidak melakukan promo melalui social media (Facebook dan Twitter) akan tetapi  mereka rilisan EP pertama mereka yang berjudul “Unplugged”, menduduki posisi 3 di chart iTunes di Australia, dan termasuk ke dalam Top 20 di Selandia Baru dan Swedia. Are they band or boyband? Kemudian debut internasional mereka mulai meningkat secara signifikan ketika salah satu anggota One Direction, Louis Tomlinson memposting link YouTube yang ternyata adalah video lagu mereka “Gotta Get Out”, yang menyatakan bahwa ia adalah penggemar dari 5 Seconds of Summer. Menjelang akhir tahun 2012, 5 Seconds of Summer merilis single mereka yang berjudul “Out of My Limit” yang dimana videoklip untuk lagu ini langsung mendapat 100.000 viewer kurang dari 24 jam.

Setelah selesai melakukan “Take Me Home Tour” bersama One Direction, 5 Seconds of  Summer kembali ke Australia, dan melakukan tour nasional mereka di sana. Semua tiket  terjual habis hanya dalam beberapa menit. Di akhir tauhun 2013, band ini mengumumkan bahwa mereka telah menandatangani kontrak dengan Capitol Records. Congrats! Dan tidak lama setelah itu, 5 Seconds of Summer meluncurkan single perdana mereka “She Look So Perfect” pada 5 februari 2014. Dan dalam waktu dua hari, single She Look So Perfect langsung menduduki posisi puncak di banyak negara termasuk Argentina, Brazil, Spanyol, Malaysia, New Zaeland, dan Inggris. 5 seconds of menjadi band keempat Australia yang mampu menduduki posisi puncak di Inggris, dan menjadi yang pertama melakukannya dalam 14 tahun. Invasi “She look So Perfect” berlanjut, kali ini “She Look so Perfect” mengambil alih chart radio di Amerika, dan EP mereka yang diberi judul yang sama menduduki posisi nomor 2 di Billboard 200, serta berhasil menjual 143.000 copy  dalam minggu pertama. Wow. Dampak dari kedekatan mereka dengan One Direction mulai dikait-kaitkan oleh masyarakat luas. Media menyebut bahwa  5 Seconds of Summer adalah Boyband sama seperti One Direction. Tapi 5 Seconds of Summer dengan tegas menyangkal kalau mereka bukan boyband seperti One Direction, karena mereka menulis lagu mereka sendiri, memainkan instrumen mereka sendiri, dan tidak melakukan koreografi seperti One Direction. Meskipun begitu, tetap saja banyak orang menyebut mereka Boyband. Tapi 5 seconds of Summer tak ambil pusing dengan pemberitaan yang menyebut mereka Boyband. Dan akhirnya pada akhir Juni 2014, 5 Seconds of Summer secara resmi merilis album mereka yang diberi judul dengan naman band mereka sendiri, yaitu  5 Seconds Summer. And guess what? Album ini memenangkan Kerrang! Awards. Itu adalah cerita singkat tentang perjalanan quartet asal Australia yang oleh bayak kalangan menyebut mereka Boyband, tapi tidak sedikit juga yang menyebut mereka adalah band yang digadang-gadang akan mampu menghidupkan kembali scene musik Pop Punk di industri musik mainstream, walaupun sebenernya lagu-lagu mereka terdengar begitu catchy pop . Bukan tanpa alasan beberapa kalangan menyebut mereka sebagai band Pop Punk , karena band yang sebelum mencapai titik kesuksesan seperti sekarang ini dulunya adalah band biasa saja yang seperti banyak band yang baru terbentuk melakukan promosi lagu atau coveran dari band/penyanyi terkenal melalui Youtube. Dan mereka pun seperti itu. Namun ada yang menarik.. Jika melihat akun Youtube 5 Seconds of Summer sekitar 3 tahun yang lalu, mereka mengcover lag dari band-band Pop Punk terkenal seperti blink182, All Time Low, dan A Day To Remember yang memang merupakan influence mereka dalam bermusik. We have to admit that their version of American Idiot (Green Day) is pretty neat Mari kita flashback sejenak, kapan terakhir kita mendengar lagu-lagu dari band seperti blink182, New Found Glory, Sum41 atau Good Charlotte diputar di radio-radio selama berminggu-minggu atau melihat video klip mereka di channel televisi mainstream secara terus-menerus  dengan dukungan penuh dari industri musik mainstream? Ah, itu sudah lama sekali. Kalian gak harus suka dengan band ini atau harus mendengarkan lagu-lagu mereka, hanya saja sepertinya kita perlu berterimakasih karena band ini seperti membuka jalan lagi bagi scene musik Pop Punk untuk tampil lagi di industri musik mainstream. Dan jika melihat jumlah fans mereka di seluruh di dunia yang tidak begitu jauh beda dengan fans One Direction yang kebanyakan terdiri dari remaja-remaja belasan tahun, tidak menutup kemungkinan fans 5 Seconds of Summer yang bisa dibilang adalah pendengar musik mainstream akan mulai mendengar lagu-lagu seperti Mayday Parade, All Time Low, The Summer Set, dan beberapa band yang menjadi influence 5 Seconds of Summer. Jika karena tampang yang memang lebih mirip boyband adalah alasan kenapa 5 seconds of summer bisa seterkenal sepertisekarang ini, maka fans dari seconds of summer seharusnya menyukai band-band Pop Punk seperti All Time Low, The Maine, The Summer Set, dan banyak lagi band-band Pop Punk yang personelnya terdiri dari cowok-cowok ganteng idola cewek-cewek. Dengan skil bermusik yang di atas rata-rata, tentunya. Hahaha.. oke, ini gak terlalu penting. Sekarang semua kembali lagi ke 5 Seconds of Summer. Apakah mereka akan lebih berani menunjukkan musikalitas mereka atau mungkin mereka malah akan menurunkan standar musik mereka ke arah yang lebih simple demi mempertahankan fans-fans mereka? Ketakutan seperti sangat lumrah untuk band yang memang sudah memiliki massa yang banyak. Beberapa band kadang lebih memikirkan selera pasar/fans mereka ketimbang naluri bermusik mereka sendiri. Akan tetapi, tidak sedikit juga band yang mempertahankan kualitas musik mereka, bukan karena pasar/fans, tapi karena memang naluri bermusik mereka seperti itu. Dan dengan sendirinya fans atau pendengar akan mengikuti perkembangan musik mereka. Satu contoh adalah New Found Glory. Di awal kemunculannya, band Pop Punk ini memiliki banyak fans, bahkan di seluruh dunia. Lalu 15 tahun kemudian, saat mereka masih memainkan musik yang sama, bahkan lebih variatif dari musik-musik mereka sebelumnya, mereka tetap eksis dan memiliki fans yang loyal. Dan di setiap pertunjukan mereka, di seluruh dunia, selalu pecah kalau seperti istilahnya anak EDM. Well, mari berdoa semoga fenomena 5 Second of Summer ini merupakan gerbang bagi scene musik Pop Punk untuk menunjukkan eksistensinya lagi di industri musik mansitream.

Well, here it is: Jack and Jameson on tap. Bocce on the patio. Hand-pressed burgers. $6 double Caesars on Sundays. Shall we go on? Local Public Eatery (171 E. Liberty St.) is a West Coast import that’s set to change the landscape of Liberty Village. Taking over the space Origin Liberty recently vacated, they’ve moved in and quickly made it all their own. A bakery, open concept kitchen, shuffleboard table, split-flap display for their rotating taps (you know it as that awesome train station-style sign ), and 120 seats spread around high-tops, low-tops, and deep leather booths. It’s the kind of place you walk into and immediately feel comfortable enough to have one...or one too many. Outside, nearly 90 more seats rest in the heart of the historic district on a brick-lined patio that features the aforementioned, sure-to-cause-fights bocce ball court as well as hanging lights that lend it a New York feel come nighttime. Even before we get to the food and drink, Local Public Eatery is already a perfect fit for the Toronto YP. But that’s their goal. Local isn’t in the name by coincidence. Old black and white photos of Liberty Village line the walls on the way to the washroom. The back of the paper menu is a map of the surrounding area with highlights including: “Ontario Place: Where N’SYNC made their Canadian debut. That’s awesome.” And there’s a community chalkboard they actually dare to leave chalk out for. There’s a feeling like you’ve been here before – but that you also want to come back. The menu helps that feeling. Full of everything from starters and sharing plates to six burger options (all on fresh baked buns), salads, sandwiches, fish tacos, and huevos rancheros available all day, every day, we’re pretty sure you won’t struggle to find something tasty to satisfy whatever craving happens to hit. Combine this with one of the most impressive drink programs we’ve seen in a long time (the drink menu is larger than the food menu), daily specials, and a weekend brunch that has a ‘Recovery Room’ theme, and we can’t see any reason LPE won’t soon become your local. Officially opening tomorrow at 3pm, The Local Public Eatery will from then on be ready to take your order any day of the week from 11am-1am, and 10am-2am on weekends.

The birth of a valuable pawn of this site, and one of my personal favorite hotties, is well-deserving of a celebration. So how should we celebrate? We could bake a cake with her name on it… No? We could beat the shit out of a piñata in the shape of a Lycan… Nay? We could watch the 2012 reboot of TOTAL RECALL… Woah! I was just kidding, put down that knife! There's one way we can all have fun celebrating Katey Beck's b-day. How? Why, with gifs, of course! There are plenty of excellent gif-worthy moments from this spandex-loving hottie, so let's ogle a bunch of them in honor of this special occasion. I'm sure Kate would appreciate it. First, let's introduce the birthday girl... This is an outtake from UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING, and it's just plain adorable, if I may use that word on this testosterone-fueled site. As many of you probably know by now, the set of UNDERWORLD is where Kate met her husband Len Wiseman, who directed the film. What a wise man. Such a lovely couple. Something you may not be aware of is that Kate auditioned for the role of Rachel Keller in THE RING, but lost it to Naomi Watts. The reason, apparently, is that Kate looked \"too young\" for the part. Also, boobies. She works out. Kate can speak Russian, and studied French and Russian Literature at Oxford University before persuing an acting career. However, she does not have a driver's license. She drives us crazy. In 1997, Kate put her soothing voice to good use by narrating two books, Emma and The Proposal . She also lent her voice to the radio version of Romeo & Juliet,  directed by Michael Sheen. This has nothing to do with the gif above (from WHITEOUT), but it's interesting nonetheless. She's exploding with hotness. Kate has been featured as one of  Eve magazine's \"Most Beautiful Women\", FHM 's and Stuff magazine's \"Sexiest Women in the World\",  Maxim 's \"Hot 100\" list, \"England's #1 Beauty\" by Hello Magazine , and Esquire 's \"Sexiest Woman Alive\" in 2009. She works hard, and plays hard. When cast as a nurse in PEARL HARBOR, Kate had to learn an American accent and gain 20 pounds. She was anorexic as a teenager, and used to suffer from stomach ulsers. She's a heavy breather. Because she's paranoid about \"having bad breath\", Kate insists on taking a breath mint before any kissing scenes. Hey, Kate, your breath smells fine to me! (The gif above was taken from VAN HELSING). She's a dirty girl. Kate has also stated that she hates wearing panties, and her solution to this problem is not to wear them. God bless you, Kate! We only wish she'd use that technique in her photoshoots. (The gif above was taken from LAUREL CANYON). \"She's got a great ass! \" - Al Pacino After winning the mantlers for \"Jean Claude God Damn\" at Spike TV's Guys Choice Awards, Kate thanked them for giving an award to her \"shiny, black ass\". It was much deserved, Kate, much deserved. She's an absolute MILF. From the years 2010-2011, Kate was unable to find a script she felt passionat about, so instead, she opted to spend time with her daughter. Her return to the big screen in 2012 was gracefully acceepted by those looking to fill their popcorn boxes with drool. Happy Birthday, Kate! Might as well end this thing right, with a gif from this expertly shot scene from WHITEOUT. A similar gif was used in our very first TGIFs column , but I don't think we'll be hearing any complaints.

Since then it has expanded to over 24 acres and is estimated to be 750 feet deep. While it’s well-known that the sinkhole occasionally swallows up nearby trees , no one has ever captured this terrifying sight on camera…until now. Not only does this monster sinkhole swallow trees, every few weeks it “burps” up between 20-100 barrels of crude oil . It has also unlocked an underground reserve of natural gas , which has seeped beneath nearby houses and could potentially cause dangerous explosions. A year after it first appeared, the sinkhole shows no signs of slowing down as it continues to expand. This isn’t the first time a salt dome has been the site of a man-made disaster . Methane leaks in similar underground caverns have forced residents out of towns in Louisiana and Texas — and in Hutchinson, Kansas, a 2001 cavern leak cause an explosion that killed two people. These aren’t simply tragic accidents, they are the accepted results of modern mining techniques. Earlier this August, the state of Louisiana filed a lawsuit against Texas Brine for the environmental damage caused by the sinkhole. A federal class-action lawsuit has also been filed against the company by the residents who have been affected by the collapse. For now, Texas Brine has offered to buy out the properties of 92 different households that have been affected — an offer that about half the families have taken up.

In the time I’ve been a member, as well as a journalist covering the party, few of its contradictions have baffled me more than the fact that it is called the Liberal Democrat party but it unequivocally fails to support the only liberal democracy in the Middle East. There has always been a strong link between British Jewry and Liberal parties, but the present day Liberal Democrats are broadly not trusted by the Jewish community. This is despite the best efforts of Nick Clegg and others to rebuild links. This was brought home to me only a couple of months ago, when I was knocking on doors for the Lib Dems as a council candidate in the London Borough of Barnet. My ward took in part of the Jewish community in Golders Green. One evening a man answered the door, only to slam it very quickly when I told him which party I was from, shouting: ‘I won’t vote for you, you’re an anti-Semitic party.’ If only he had been an one off… For a party that tries to be accessible and politically correct, the Lib Dems have a cultural blind spot over the Jewish community. A perfect example is that, come October, they will have held their autumn party conference over Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, four years in a row. Once happens, twice is a bad coincidence, four times and you’re telling a community that you don’t really pay them much attention. You can’t help but ask: what is the Lib Dems’ problem with ‘the Jews’? Many people joined due to a strong belief in human rights and a determination to stick up for the ‘little guy’. Honourable positions to hold, but easily warped when looking at the Middle East. Lib Dems, particularly at the grassroots level, see Israel with a thriving economy and a proper military, and assume that this makes it an evil Goliath, and the Palestinians therefore the noble David. It’s a binary view, not to mention a misinformed one. They all too easily ignore that Israel is about the same size as Wales or the state of New Jersey and has been attacked ever since its formation. They don’t think about the human rights of Israeli citizens to live their daily lives without being bombarded by Hamas’s missiles. With these foundations laid, the likes of David Ward and Jenny Tonge can share their vile views under some political cover. Indeed, there are plenty of Lib Dem members who publicly agreed with David Ward this week, and the same was true of Tonge before she was finally given her marching orders. It demonstrates how easily anti-Israel and anti-Zionist sentiment can veer towards what could be regarded as anti-Semitism. It’s hard for the party leadership to take action against these outbursts. The perpetrators can legitimately say that party members are backing them. The leadership fears a backlash from activists. The Lib Dems remain a member and process driven party. Many times this works to the party’s advantage. Not so in matters of discipline. I have little doubt that Clegg and his whips would have liked to show David Ward the door this week, but the bureaucratic way the party is setup made that almost impossible. That said, it’s hard to imagine either of the other two major parties hiding behind ‘process’ when dealing with such comments from their benches. David Ward’s despicable comments this week were just the latest in a series of incidents that have dogged the Liberal Democrats. With a bit of subtlety and nuance, it’s more than possible to make comments that are stridently critical of Israel without approaching the realms of anti-Semitism. Subtlety and nuance were exactly what was missing from Ward this week, and his defender, former MEP Edward McMillan Scott . I have no idea how I’d now answer that man in Golders Green.", "score"=>157.16556, "summaryTitle"=>"What is the Lib Dems’ problem with ‘the Jews’?", "type"=>"search", "cities"=>"gb-h9-london", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/07/what-is-the-lib-dems-problem-with-the-jews/", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "direct", "bitnamiapp.com", "twittergadget.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1zcdppk", "lastseen"=>"20140726004200", "page"=>"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2014/07/what-is-the-lib-dems-problem-with-the-jews/", "ogtitle"=>"What is the Lib Dems&#039; problem with &#039;the Jews&#039;? - Spectator Blogs"}, {"domain"=>"statesman.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406326966000", "h2"=>["Sign in with your existing account", "Sign in with your email", "New User?", "Welcome Back {* welcomeName *}", "Welcome back.

Northern cardinal, blue jay, grackle … Those are pretty easy, but there are so many more! Birding is one of the fastest-growing outdoor activities in the U.S. With 639 species of birds documented in Texas, things really are bigger and better here in the Lone Star State. Birding in Texas is year-round, thanks to our location and diverse eco-regions, and can be rewarding in every corner of the state. TPWD's wildlife trails make it easier than ever to find the best birding hot spots. Learning to identify all our state’s birds can be a daunting task, so here’s a list that’s been trimmed down to some of the more ubiquitous and easily seen species. So, armed with this starter list and a helpful birding guidebook and a pair of binoculars, head out to your yard and see how many you can spot and identify. Once you’ve conquered your own little patch of green, try it at a state park. Bring family and friends and turn it into a contest. You’ll find being bird-brained is fun for everyone.   Northern Mockingbird Such a list, of course, has to begin with the state bird of Texas. This gray and white bird makes up for its drab appearance with a voice that could compete in any singing competition. The Latin name (Mimus polyglottos), which translates loosely to “the many-tongued mimic,” really sums up this songster. Instead of singing its own song, this bird performs like a tribute band playing an original band’s song note for note. A seasoned male mockingbird can sing the songs of dozens of other species found nearby and make a variety of other vocalizations, from frog sounds to car alarms.   ﻿Red-Tailed Hawk ﻿Known colloquially as the “chicken hawk,” this large raptor can be seen in just about any open habitat, with numbers reaching their peak in Texas during the cold winter months. Often seen sitting on a commanding perch along our highways, the hawks look as if they’re watching traffic pass by when, in fact, the grassy medians support lots of tasty rodents. This fondness for rodents makes them good neighbors for us. Instead of red, look on the top of the tail for more of a terracotta-orange color. While it’s perched, two of its best features are often visible on many but not all individuals: a dark belly-band across its white underparts and the messy white blotches on an otherwise chocolate-colored back.   ﻿Great Blue Heron More old-timers refer to this species as a “blue crane,” but this heron is not related to cranes. This tall wetland inhabitant will hunt for fish, frogs, crayfish and the like in just about any creek, pond, lake or roadside ditch. With an overall grayish color, this bird does have hints of blue-gray here and there. In flight, the great blue heron might conjure up beliefs that pterodactyls still fly our friendly skies. When waters freeze in winter, don’t expect these birds to chip away at the ice. Instead, watch them switch to dry upland settings in search of rodents. Who knows, maybe a switch from slimy fish to furry rats every now and then breaks the monotony!   ﻿Barn Swallow Some call it the “mud swallow” because it builds open, cup-shaped nests from mud on bridges, culverts, porches and patios. If a nest shows up on your front porch, you might have to deal with occasional dive-bombs from a protective parent and a small pile of poop you’ll have to wash off. These aerial insectivores are good neighbors, though, since they eat a lot of our yard’s pesky insects; in some cultures, it’s a sign of good luck if the nesting birds select your home. Watch for their deeply forked tail and, when the sunlight hits them just right, a beautiful iridescence of dark blue-purple on the head, back and tail. There are two other mud-nesting swallows in Texas, the cliff and cave swallows, but neither has a forked tail. Also, the cliff swallow sets itself apart in terms of architectural design with a gourd-shaped mud nest.   Turkey Vulture Early American settlers from Europe confused this carrion eater with the “buzzard” back home, but the two aren’t alike. Though the name “buzzard” is used in other parts of the world for hawks, it refuses to be erased from our vocabulary for vultures. When soaring, this vulture has a silvery tinge to the trailing edge of the entire wing. When they’re feasting on roadkill, notice their milk chocolate coloration and, in adults, a red featherless head. Only a mother could love a face like that. There is another species of vulture in Texas: the black vulture. The black vulture sports a gray featherless head and is dark black. During flight, black vultures also have the silvery tinge to their wings but only on the outer tips. If we didn’t have vultures, our roadways would soon be overrun with smelly, unsightly roadkill.   Killdeer How great would it be if every bird were named for its vocalization, like this one? A resounding “kill-dee, kill-dee, kill-dee” can be heard not only in natural settings, but also in ball fields and parking lots. In flight, watch for the fiery orange rump and pointy wings and, when perched, watch for two distinctive black bands across the breast resembling wide necklaces. If you approach one and find it limping away with a drooped wing and loud cries, know that you’re being duped. This action — called feigning — is designed to lure you away from a nearby ground nest or nestlings, so tread lightly.   House Sparrow This species is not native to the Western Hemisphere. Introduced more than a century ago, it has spread from Alaska to Argentina and all points in between, including Texas. Our state’s first sighting was in Galveston in 1867. If there are a few houses or grain silos around, there will be house sparrows. They’re actually weaver finches; folks who have found their bulky nests constructed of wispy grasses can attest to this. Purple martin landlords who aren’t monitoring their nest boxes can get overrun with these pesky sparrows. The male has a black goatee; the female is very dull and plain, but her pale eyebrow is readily seen. In urban settings, this is the expected sparrow in parking lots, often gathering into huge, noisy roosts each evening.   Brown-headed Cowbird This bird evolved with the ever-moving herds of bison, and the constant moving never allowed it to settle down and raise a family. So it developed a habit of dumping its eggs into the nests of unsuspecting foster parents. Now they follow livestock, bringing them closer to a wider array of foster parents. This creates conservation concerns for other bird species. The cowbird’s name makes sense once you’ve spotted a male with a shiny-black body and flat-brown head. The female, however, doesn’t have the same paint job. She has no streaks, no spots, no speckles, no bling — just one shade of earth-tone, grayish-brown. Watch for them to attack your seed feeder or cruise through a mowed lawn.   Red-winged Blackbird In springtime, no other bird is more noticeable or recognizable than the male red-winged blackbird. He sports striking epaulets of crimson red against a glossy black body. The female, though, has a completely different appearance. Heavily streaked and looking like a jumbo-sized sparrow (which is the section of the bird book where many new birders look to identify her), she is likely the most misidentified bird in our state. Look for her noticeable pale eyebrow and that blackbird-like bill. She’s often in flocks with other females of her kind, and, in the breeding season, she becomes one of her mate’s many girlfriends; he maintains a harem, which he fiercely guards and protects.   Eurasian Collared-Dove This non-native dove first arrived in Texas via Texarkana in 1995 and quickly spread throughout the state. In urban settings, watch for a large pale dove with a black ring around the collar. More importantly, open your ears to the incessant cooing sounds of these doves, as they are prolific singers. A unique vocalization they make as they’re taking flight or about to land is reminiscent of a loud kitty’s meow. If you spot them at the seed feeder, you’ll see that these doves are larger than their native cousins, the white-winged and mourning doves. The collared dove has taken the place of the paler, ringed turtle-dove, another non-native dove, and appears to be calling Texas home for a long time to come.   American Coot I don’t think it’s a compliment to be called an “old coot,” but it’s OK to spot some on a nearby lake or reservoir. Since this bird needs a running start in order to take off from the water, it doesn’t hang out in small bodies of water. If you find one there, it’s usually an indication that inclement weather grounded the bird and the runway is too short for it to take off again. Commonly occurring in rafts, or large floating flocks of birds, this all-dark bird has a pale white bill and feeds on aquatic organisms and vegetation. This species, no relation to ducks, pours into Texas during fall to spend the winter months where water doesn’t freeze, but watch for most to head north in spring. Some stick around throughout the year and raise a family. The young look similar in shape but have a whitish head that distinguishes them from mom and dad.   Cattle Egret Sometimes referred to as “cow birds” for their fondness of following cattle, these birds are fairly new to Texas, making their debut here in 1955 on Mustang Island. They follow cattle because, while walking or grazing, big bovines flush insects hiding in the grass. Those insects are precisely what the egret desires. The egret is not plucking ticks off the hides of livestock, a common misbelief. During the breeding season, watch for straw-colored patches of feathers on the head, breast and back of these otherwise white birds. These birds seek refuge in numbers. Their communal nesting colonies, called rookeries (or, more correctly, heronries), can be very large, with nests numbering in the thousands and often mixed with other species of egrets, herons, ibises, cormorants and more. There’s great safety in numbers — humans live in similar settings we just call neighborhoods.   » Like this story?

Roswell says his family was just 100 feet away from where a New Jersey couple was killed after a tree fell on their campsite. He says there were campers flipped on their sides, others completely destroyed and trees fallen all around. He describes how one of his campsite neighbors survived a near-death experience. \"The lady had heard the noise starting and she got up out of bed to go to the window to look and when she got up out of the bed, that was when the tree feel through her bedroom,\" he says. Roswell thankful his family survived the tornado says the frightening experience will forever impact his life. \"After having seen how quickly something can be taken from you as a family or as a person, stuff is stuff, it doesn't matter but you appreciate your friends and family more.\" After spending most of the day at an emergency shelter Roswell and his family left Cherrystone yesterday and headed to another campground in Virginia Beach to continue their vacation.

Two men, a 53-year old pilot and co-pilot, 29, from Thorndale Ontario were traveling to Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Their seaplane crashed southwest of Point North Landing, a permanent camp near Wollaston Lake. The camp has an airport, gas station and accommodations. Search and Rescue technicians with the Department of National Defence are extracting the two men, who will be taken by Griffon helicopter to Points North. A Hercules aircraft will take them to Saskatoon for medical assessment. There are no details on the nature of the injuries or cause of the crash at this time. The plane called the Winnipeg Flight Control Center around 11:50 a.m., which relayed the message onto RCMP Saskatchewan's Divisional Operational Communications Center. Wollaston Lake RCMP are on scene and Transport Canada has been notified.  paNOW has calls in with RCMP for more details and will provide them as they come Emergency landing in La Rong e A small plane had to land in La Ronge on Friday morning because of a crack in the windshield that caused a loss in cabin pressure. Low cabin pressure can cause physiological problems resulting in passenger death.  The call came after 10 a.m. to La Ronge RCMP, and La Ronge paramedics, fire and RCMP were on scene before the plane landed safely at La Ronge’s airport.

The final decision now lies with the EU's Member States, but I believe that this is an effective, well-targeted and balanced package providing the flexibility to adjust our reaction to changes on the ground.  I hope that Member States will agree on this package of restrictive measures next week. I recall that these measures are not an end in themselves, but a means to achieve a negotiated and political solution to the crisis - which remains the EU's firm priority. I call on Russia to take decisive steps to stop the violence and genuinely engage in peace plan discussions.\" Background In its conclusions on Ukraine of 22 July, the Foreign Affairs Council requested \"the Commission and the EEAS to finalise their preparatory work on possible targeted measures and to present proposals for taking action, including on access to capital markets, defence, dual use goods, and sensitive technologies, including in the energy sector.\" In line with this request, on 24 July the Commission presented to the Council a document outlining a number of measures that could be taken in the areas set out by the Council conclusions and the procedure that should be followed to adopt the relevant legal instruments. The document built on the preparatory work conducted by the Commission services, in cooperation with the EEAS, in response to the mandate given by the March European Council. The Council's Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) held on 24 July an exchange of views on the basis of this preparatory work and returned to this matter at its meeting today (25 July). Given the broad agreement on the Commission's approach, the European Commission has tabled this evening the necessary legislative proposals in all areas identified by the Council. What next? It is now for Member States to agree on the Commission's proposals. The Council's Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) is due to go through the legislative proposals next Tuesday (29 July).

Tanner Hall and Simon Dumont-two of the sport's most powerful personalities to date-were just starting to get a rivalry going in the halfpipe that would be a focal point of the Winter X Games year after year. Both were in the midst of the strongest part of their careers, with Tanner recovering from two broken ankles suffered during a session on Utah's legendary Chad's Gap-he stomped a mind-bending switch cork 900 at 53 mph-to win X Games gold. Monochromatic matching outfits were all the rage, with Jon Olson leading the charge with the most egregious color combos. Giant gaps of all kinds were the rage, often dominated by bona fide Transformer/stunt jumper Mike Wilson. A huge roster of future legends, from slopestyle dominator TJ Schiller to our own Sage Cattabriga-Alosa, were just getting started. During the winter of 2006, all these guys skied in front of the lens of  Kris Ostness -a legend in his own right. His Line Ostness Dragons were one of the first full-length twin-tip skis in history, and he helped pioneer the push into giant backcountry gap jumps in his home turf of Utah; he built up the 120-foot Chad's Gap for the very first time with Chad Zurinskas himself. Kris took to ski filmmaking with a similarly pioneering vision-a taste for cerebral-feeling films that left a mark on anyone who saw them.   Teddybear Crisis , the film he made with Henrik Rostrup and Howie Arnstad, remains to this day one of the most memorable films about the freeski movement ever made. Whether it was the countless Utah canyon gaps, Mike Wilson's groundbreaking double over the Snowbird halfpipe gap, the super-creative intros and awesome soundtrack, or simply the way the trio decided to film each segment with barely a tripod for equipment, it's a pretty special thing that this entire film is available for free online.

On Thursday the team brought in a reserve offensive lineman to help out in camp while releasing cornerback Brandon Smith. Just hours before their Friday evening practice, the Bills replenished the cornerback position. The team announced that they've come to terms with free agent cornerback Bobby Felder. A former undrafted free agent out of Nicholls State in 2012, Felder spent the past two seasons on a practice squad. During his rookie season, he was with the Minnesota Vikins practice unit. He then signed on with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the same role in 2013. To make room for Felder on the roster, the Bills released defensive tackle Colby Way from the team. An undrafted free agent out of the University at Buffalo, Way signed with the team shortly after the 2014 NFL Draft. He was likely made expendable with the signing of defensive tackle Landon Cohen earlier in the week. The Bills removed one more off their non-participation list for training camp. Seventh-round pick and rookie linebacker Randell Johnson started camp on the Active/Physically Unable to Perform list but has now been cleared by the medical staff and will resume practice with his teammates. All that remains on the team's non-participation lists are left tackle Cordy Glenn (Active/Non-Football Illness) and linebacker Kiko Alonso (Active/Non-Football Injury). The Bills resume practice Friday night at 6 pm at St. John Fisher College.

Every spring, we launch a collection of new Dritz sewing supplies. How do we come up with these new items, you might wonder? Well, sometimes the new items are a result of trends we see in fashion (new buckles and swivel hooks for bracelets). Sometimes we revive vintage Dritz notions (love that bound buttonhole tool!). And most often, we’re bringing to market sewing tools to make your hobby easier and more enjoyable. Ready to learn more? Fine, sharp edges and no mess – now this is a clever tool. The new Dritz Tailor’s Chalk Sharpener removes rough edges and nicks on chalk’s edge so you can create smoother markings. The chalk dust stays inside the sharpener – just open the handy bottom door on its base and shake it out after sharpening. Soft grip tweezers, yes please! These feature a soft grip cushion and sharp, angled tips. The sharp points on the tips grasp objects tightly and securely. You’ll use these for threading hard-to-reach areas on sergers and sewing machines. They’re also great for crafts, like beading and jewelry making. What’s old is new again. The Dritz Bound Buttonhole Tool is a vintage sewing tool we’ve revived! During the sewing construction process, this metal jig assists in creating uniform bound buttonholes up to 1-1/2″ long. It helps you add a touch of tailored couture fashion to garments. Yes! Bracelets, backpack straps, dog leashes and paracord crafts – yup, these are some of the most popular DIY projects at the moment. You’ll use these new parachute buckles with belting, cord and elastics. The buckles are slightly curved, making them ideal for wearable accessories like belts. (If you like that pink belting shown, that’s new, too! You’ll find an assortment of Dritz polypro belting in the sewing department – just ask to have it cut by the yard in the store.) No stray pins here. The Dritz Wrist Felt Pin Cushion features a large, flexible wrist band. Its sturdy felt cushion holds pins securely as you move from cutting table, to sewing machine, to ironing board. Handy, huh? Put the finishing touch on a variety of projects. The new swivel hooks finish key chains, bracelets and other cording crafts. Used with D-rings, they create detachable or internal hooks in bags and totes. The new carabiner has a spring action opening used to clip two objects together. You can insert small fabric loops on phone cases, bags and totes, and attach your carabiner to hold special items in a specific place. In addition to the cool tools above, we’ve launched some bold new elastics this spring. And finally – you’ll find Dritz Key Fob Hardware in the sewing notions department, too! Do these new sewing supplies give you ideas? We’d love to hear what’s next up on your sewing list.

A statement issued by the company this afternoon reads as follows: Unfortunately we have no choice but to cancel tonight’s performance. Secret Cinema has been running safe arts events for 10 years and on this occasion we have come across a number of issues that we have not experienced previously. The site is looking spectacular so please standby for further information about Saturday night’s event. The company has turned a portion of the Olympic Park site into a sizeable replica of Hill Valley, the town from Back to the Future. Ticket holders for tonight will not gain entry but have been offered replacements on other nights — which, of course, is no use if you’ve travelled a long distance, as many have. Curiously, no reason for the cancellations has yet been given. Angry tweets about the production company’s competence and lack of information are flying around on Twitter and Facebook, and are well documented elsewhere. Amid the fury, it should be kept in mind that we still don’t know the cause — a specific terror threat or (as some rumours speculate) an unexploded WWII bomb, would be two possible reasons that the production company could not have foreseen (barring genuine time travel) that would lead to cancellation. Some kind of security threat might go part way to explaining the lack of information. Either way, Secret Cinema is truly living up to its name in the most frustrating way possible.

The film opened to many packed houses on Friday morning. As expected, Kick is slated to break the box office records. Firstly, the film released on around 4400 screens in India alone. The morning shows at many centres opened housefull and at other centres the occupancy ranged from 60 percent to 80 percent. This is a phenomenal start, and considering the wide release, the film is set to become the biggest opener of the year 2014. Let’s not forget that Kick has released on a non-holiday and has hit the theatres in the run up to Eid-ul-Fitr. The month of Ramadan which keeps a lot of viewers away is not over yet. Movie Review : 'Kick' is a treat for Salman Khan fans To give you a perspective, Salman Khan’s biggest opening film to date is Ek Tha Tiger . It made Rs. 32.93 crore net on the first day which was a holiday (15 August 2012). It remains to be seen if Kick , directed by Sajid Nadiadwala , will surpass that despite being a non-holiday opener. Also featuring Jacqueline Fernandez , Randeep Hooda and Nawazuddin Siddiqui , Kick is sure to surpass Salman’s previous release ' Jai Ho ' in terms of opening day business. Jai Ho had made Rs. 17.75 crore on 24 January 2014. PHOTOS : Bollywood celebs watch ‘Kick’ The positives in favour of Kick are aplenty. It’s an Eid release and will pick hugely on Eid holiday next week. It has no competition at the box office for two weeks. The next big release would be Akshay Kumar’s Entertainment on August 8.

The Mexico international has recently been linked with a move to La Liga champions Atletico Madrid, who are also keen to secure a deal for Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla. According to the Express , Atletico boss Diego Simeone is keen to wrap up a £30 million deal for the Premier League duo, who are both reportedly unhappy at their respective clubs. Related links Hernandez frozen out by Van Gaal? Spanish newspaper Marca reported on Thursday that Van Gaal had attempted to stop Hernandez from joining United’s pre-season tour of the US in an effort to force him out of the club. However, the Mexican joined up with the rest of his teammates earlier this week and is expected to play some part in Saturday’s International Challenge Cup fixture against AS Roma. It could be one of the final chances that the 26-year-old has to impress the veteran Dutch coach, with first-choice striker Robin van Persie set to return to the fold following his World Cup exploits with the Netherlands in Brazil. Hernandez faces more frustration But, even if Hernandez produces an impressive display against the Serie A giants in Denver this weekend, Van Persie will return to take his place as United’s most-advanced forward, regardless. It seems the best the Mexican can hope for in the early stages of the 2014/15 campaign is a place on the substitutes’ bench. Van Gaal was asked by reporters whether Hernandez had a future at Old Trafford on Tuesday - but his response would have done little to ease the player’s concerns. \"I will have to see how he plays,\" Van Gaal told reporters . \"I have only seen him under another coach so far. He has arrived today and now I can see him play in a game. Then I can talk about him.\" Hernandez endured an unhappy 2013/14 campaign under Van Gaal’s predecessor David Moyes. He scored just nine goals in 35 (mostly substitute) appearances, and posted a number of cryptic social messages indicating his discontent. Mexico boss Miguel Herrera also told reporters , back in February, that the striker was deeply unhappy with his lack of playing time at Old Trafford. Watch: Hernandez - Man United's super sub Where next for Hernandez? Atletico certainly have the funds to finance a deal for Hernandez after offloading Diego Costa and Filipe Luis to Chelsea for substantial fees. However, the Madrid-based outfit face stiff competition from Inter Milan and Valencia. Arsenal and Tottenham have also been linked with the live-wire goal poacher in recent weeks.

More than 180,000 women of European descent participated in the 57 studies used for Perry’s analysis. Some of the influence on the age of menarche appeared to come from imprinted genes—in which a copy from one parent is silenced to favor the expression of the other parent’s copy. “Our findings imply that in a family, one parent may more profoundly affect puberty timing in their daughters than the other parent,” Perry said in a statement . According to the press release, this is the first time imprinted genes have been linked to controlling development after birth. “We knew that some imprinted genes control antenatal growth and development—but there is increasing interest in the possibility that imprinted genes may also control childhood maturation and later life outcomes, including disease risks,” said Perry.", "score"=>156.64613, "summaryTitle"=>"The Scientist", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Hundreds of loci in the genome are associated with the age at which a girl starts menstruating.", "cities"=>"us", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40575/title/The-Genetics-of-Menarche/", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1pSj1zv", "lastseen"=>"20140726004747", "page"=>"http://www.the-scientist.com/", "ogtitle"=>"The Genetics of Menarche | The Scientist Magazine&reg;"}, {"domain"=>"gymnastike.org", "initial_epoch"=>"1406318454000", "h3"=>["Coverage Videos", "Comment using:", "Comment using Email:", "Login to Comment", "Back to other Comment Options"], "site"=>"www.gymnastike.org", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004537", "keywords"=>"national championships gymnastics, 2014 P&G Championships, elite gymnastics, mckayla maroney, kyle ross, simone biles", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335537081", "title"=>"2014 P&G Championships Qualifiers - Gymnastike", "initial"=>"20140725200054", "summaryText"=>"Becca from Gymnastike on Jul 21, 2014 | More Posts Pictured: Simone Biles With the 2014 P&G Championships a month away, the women's competition field is beginning to take shape.

As someone who has attended hundreds of shows and conferences in the last decade, it’s says something that Mozcon has become my favorite event ever after just two visits (2013 and 2014). The comradery, the information, the people, the setting (Seattle rocks!) and the spirit of the affair serves to light a fire that continues to burn long after the event is exhausted. This year, however, Mozcon went quite a bit further, by making me proud. The event opened (after Rand’s official opening) with a strong female speaker, Kerry Bodine, who delivered the goods on customer experience, then never let up, with three other awesome female presenters—Lindsay Wassell, Cindy Krum and Lexi Mills—rounding out the first day. The pride I felt had to do with the number of women presenters, the substance of their talks and knowing they’d killed it, shutting up the critics (not likely, but hopefully) who normally huddle after such events and nitpick every damn thing. As each female speaker owned the stage that first day, I was continually saying to myself, “What you got now?” to critics real and imagined. Let me be clear: This isn’t a male vs. female thing, and I’m not grasping at straws trying to make something out of nothing. What I’m voicing is an opinion based on my own observations. Is it scientific? No. Do critics nitpick men? Yes. And this isn’t a Mozcon issue. It’s a some-of-us-are-jerks issue. I’ve continually heard the whispers about females delivering “fluff-filled” presentations that aren’t data-driven or tactical enough for a given audience. These “assessments” have always struck me as odd, especially since the presentations being attacked were often some of the strongest of the event, quashing any notions that the comments were merit-based. It’s About The Substance Of The Information, Not About Who Is Delivering The Information Last year’s Mozcon featured a strong lineup of women as well, including Dana DiTomaso,  Aleyda Solis, Karen McGrane (one of my content strategy crushes), Lena West, Annie Cushing (the inimitable one), Brittan Bright and Mackenzie Fogelson (my sister-from-another-mother), among others. I was blown away by each of the presenters, women and men. However, when Brittan Bright spoke about how relationships are essential to building a strong business, my internal dialogue was visceral, emotive and unfiltered: “I wonder if this audience is picking up what she’s putting down? This stuff is important. Relationships are ultimately what sinks or floats a business. It ain’t SEO or content or PPC.” Later, during the party at the EMP, I overheard an interesting comment: “Yeah, today was good, but some of the stuff was…a little soft, squishy, not really applicable to what I do. I’d rather it have been more technical, or tactical. That’s just me.” He gave no real indication of the specific talk he was referring took, but my ears perked up, given that Bright’s presentation was titled “Building Your Business: Relationship and Other Critical ‘Soft’ Skills,” and she had spoken earlier that day. The words incensed me. As someone who’s spent the better part of a decade advising businesses in the areas of product design/innovation, PR, branding and content marketing, I’ve seen firsthand what elements of a enterprise places it closer to being a success: people, not products or services . And the better a company is at managing those critical relationships, both early on as the company is expanding and later as the team has swelled to multiples of its original size, the better chance the enterprise has of being a success. Again, I have no idea who, exactly, this person was singling out with his comments. Also, his was not an opinion that was shared by the larger group, in my opinion. It still grated on me. The Marketing Community Should Build One Another Up Earlier this year, I was privy to several Twitter conversations where people were discussing the dearth of women presenters, especially in technology. None of the reasons, er, excuses, given sufficed. The ongoing discussion served to remind me of past conferences, where it always seemed that the women were being judged by a different, harsher standard than the men, even when the former delivered the same level of depth and analysis as the latter. While I’m not convinced such feelings will subside anytime soon, those conferences and events that feature women presenters do pique my interest and arouse a sense of pride in me. First, I know the hosts don’t fall for the “we-can’t-find-women-presenters” B.S. And most important, I know the audience is likely to gain a different perspective, one they may not hear otherwise. As marketers, we have enough problems to deal with, whether from Google, clients or the overall pace of the industry we serve. Shouldn’t we be actively building up one another instead of nitpicking every damn thing? At any rate, I’m happy Mozcon once again delivered an amazing event, one that did not perpetuate the stereotypical crap experienced elsewhere. I’m very interested to know your thoughts.

Secara aturan, kata CT, hasil keputusan KPU tersebut sudah sah karena ditetapkan sesuai prosedur dan payung hukum yang berlaku. Akibatnya, pasar merespons negatif sikap dan pernyataan Prabowo. \"Pasar menyayangkan ini bisa terjadi, kalau seandainya bisa diterima, tentu hasilnya akan terbalik. Rupiah akan lebih menguat sangat luar biasa,\" paparnya. Meski begitu, dia menilai, hal ini merupakan kenyataan yang harus diterima oleh seluruh masyarakat Indonesia. Sehingga dirinya mengimbau agar semuanya tenang sehingga kurs rupiah dan Indeks Harga Saham Gabungan (IHSG) dapat kembali menguat. \"Saya mengimbau seluruh rakyat Indonesia, pelaku pasar, dunia usaha, domestik, swasta dan asing untuk bisa menerima kenyataan yang ada dan kita mengikuti Undang-undang (UU) yang ada. Saya berharap ( rebound ) karena keputusan KPU mutlak mengikat, tapi begitu tidak ada gugatan ya itu sah,\" tandas CT.

The 19-players selected will participate in practice on the campus of UNLV from Monday through Thursday, after which they’ll play an inter-team scrimmage on Friday. Lillard has been busy this summer between youth basketball camps , appearing at the ESPYS and traveling to the Philippines, but he’s also set aside ample time to prepare himself for the rigors of making a team comprised of the best basketball players in the world. “I’ve been working out really hard,” said Lillard. “I want to be in shape because I’m not going to have the responsibility (on Team USA)) that I have for the Trail Blazers. I’ve been shooting a lot of shots, making sure my jumper is as tight as it can possibly be, because I know I’m going to have to be able to knock down shots if I want to give myself a chance to make that team. And I’ve got to be able to “D” up. Without having the same responsibility I do with the Trail Blazers, I’m going to be able to pick up full court for my eight, nine minutes or however long I’ll be on the floor and play those eight or nine minutes as hard as I can to give something to the team and be able to make shots. I’ve been preparing myself for that.” Looking at the roster , one assumes that Lillard, who was one of the standouts of the 2013 USA Basketball minicamp last summer, has a great chance of making the team that will compete in Spain in September. With his three-point shooting and ability to play both guard positions, Lillard stacks up well against the other guards, including Derrick Rose, Kyrie Irving and Stephen Curry, vying for one of 12 roster spots. And with usual Team USA stalwarts like Chris Paul, Russell Westbrook, Kobe Bryant and Deron Williams all sitting out this cycle, Lillard’s chances of making the World Cup roster and establishing himself as a player worthy of consideration for the 2016 Olympics have never been better. “I like my chances, said Lillard. “I’ve been hearing about people dropping out and stuff like that, but as a competitor, I liked my chances before that. Just because some guys have dropped out doesn’t mean I have a spot on the team, so I’m still going to go out there and compete and try to make an impression and get to the World Championships.”  ", "score"=>156.52843, "summaryTitle"=>"Team USA Tryouts Start Monday", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Just a reminder that I'll be covering the USA Basketball training camp next week in Las Vegas as Damian Lillard tries to be one of 12 players selected to", "cities"=>"us-or", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://forwardcenter.net/team-usa-tryouts-start-monday/", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "bleacherreport.com", "t.co", "direct", "sportsmanias.com"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1l1wB0L", "lastseen"=>"20140726004251", "page"=>"http://forwardcenter.net/team-usa-tryouts-start-monday/", "ogtitle"=>"Team USA Tryouts Start Monday"}, {"domain"=>"glasgow2014.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406326165000", "h2"=>["Navigation", "News", "You are here", "You might enjoy…", "WHAT’S ON TODAY (DAY 3 – 26 JULY)", "THE SEVENS PARTY IS COMING TO IBROX – AND YOU’RE INVITED!"], "h3"=>["Log In to your ticketing account", "Check the status of your application and find out all the latest volunteering news", "Share on:"], "site"=>"www.glasgow2014.com", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004416", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335456898", "title"=>"Commonwealth Games 2014 Review – Day 2 | Glasgow 2014 - Commonwealth Games", "initial"=>"20140725220925", "summaryText"=>"It was a great day of Swimming success for England and Australia as the home nation and Oceanic country dominated the medal table.

Chris Walker-hebbron (ENG) captured his first Commonwealth Games Gold medal when he won the Men’s 100m backstroke final today. At the Delhi 2010 Games, Walker-hebron grabbed Bronze in Men’s 4 x 100 medley relay. Liam Tancock (ENG) took Bronze to claim his third consecutive medal in Men's 100m backstroke. The only male swimmers to have claimed a medal four Games in a row in a specific event are Mark Foster (ENG) in the 50m freestyle (1990-2002), and Roland Schoeman (RSA) earlier today in the Men's 50m butterfly (2002-2014). Tancock became the first swimmer to win at least one medal in Men’s 100m backstroke in three consecutive Commonwealth Games. Tancock became the oldest medal winner in Men’s 100m backstroke since Matt Welsh (AUS) took Silver aged 29 years and 122 days in 2006. With Mitch Larkin (AUS) claiming Silver and Josh Beaver (AUS) grabbing Bronze, Australia has now been medalled in Men’s 100m backstroke at the last six Games. The last time Australia failed to grab at least one medal in this event was in 1990. The Australia team of Tommaso D'orsogna (AUS), Matt Abood, James Magnussen and Cameron McEvoy later broke the Commonwealth Games record to win Gold in the Men's 4x100m freestyle relay at Tollcross Swimming Centre. Australia won in 3:13.44. South Africa took Silver in 3:15.17 and England the Bronze in 3:16.17. Lesiton Pickett (AUS) won Gold in the Women's 50m breaststroke final at the Tollcross Swimming Centre on Friday. Alia Atkinson (JAM) took Silver and Corrie Scott (SCO) the Bronze. Maddison Elliott (AUS) won Gold in the Women's para swimming 100m freestyle S8 in a world record 1:05:32 at the Tollcross Swimming Centre on Friday. Stephanie Slater (ENG) took the Silver in 1:05.73 and Lakeisha Patterson (AUS) the Bronze in 1:08:98. Dimitris Minasidis (CYP) claimed Cyprus's first ever medal in weightlifting at the Commonwealth Games, winning the Gold medal in the Men's 62kg event. Weightlifting became the eighth sport in which Cyprus have won a medal, and the fifth in which they have won Gold. Sudesh Peiris (SRI) took the Silver medal, his second in this event after claiming the Bronze medal at the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games. PEIRIS became the fourth athlete to win multiple medals in this event. Vaipava Ioane (SAM) claimed the Bronze medal, the ninth by Samoa at the Commonwealth Games, seven of which have been won in weightlifting. Chika Amalaha equalled the Commonwealth Games snatch record of 82kg with ease in her very first lift on Friday, before going on to set a new record of 85kg and a new Games best total of 196kg. It denied Gold to Dika Toua (PNG), who had been the first woman to compete in weightlifting at the Olympics when she opened the tournament at Sydney 2000. The Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games silver medallist was forced to attempt 115kg to win in her final clean and jerk, but had to settle for Silver again. She did, however, set a new Commonwealth record of 111kg in the clean and jerk. Sam Webster (NZL) took a Gold medal in a pulsating set of men's sprint races while Joanna Rowsell (ENG) dominated the women's individual pursuit during the evening session on day two of track cycling at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome. Neil Fachie (SCO) delighted the home crowd by winning Gold, and siblings Annette Edmondson and Alex Edmondson (AUS), each have a Silver medal to take back to their home country. Rowsell turned her top qualifying time into a Gold medal after applying consistent pressure to Annette Edmondson (AUS). The Englishwoman also won Gold at the London 2012 Olympic Games and the 2014 world championships. Amy Cure (AUS) took bronze from Katie Archibald (SCO). CURE held at least a 0.5sec lead for most of the race, extending her advantage in the final 1000m. Teenager Reece McFadden (SCO) defeated flyweight European champion and world No.1 Andrew Selby (WAL) in a stunning first-day upset at the SECC on Friday evening. Selby, 25, had been strongly fancied for the Gold, but McFadden, 19, oozed confidence from the moment he stepped into the ring, and went on to produce the best performance of his young career. In an explosive contest, Selby was utterly frustrated by the confident Scot who beat him to the punch, stayed low and even switched to southpaw. Selby simply could not figure him out and was unable to keep his cool. He received two warnings, for spitting out his gum shield in the third round. McFadden suggested Selby had repeatedly been spitting out his gum shield in order to disrupt the contest, which the Welshman denied. India would be the only country to record two medals on the opening day of events at Barry Buddon Shooting Centre today. Abhinav Bindra (IND) retained his 10m air rifle title for a fifth Commonwealth Gold and Malaika Goel took Silver in the 10m air pistol on a day where Singaporean Shun Xie Teo and Australian Laura Coles also won Gold medals. Nick Matthew (ENG) disposed of the home nation's top squash player Alan CLYNE (SCO) 3-0 (11-4 11-4 11-8) in their men's singles clash in the round of 16 at Scotstoun Sports Campus on Friday. The players served up an entertaining match despite CLYNE taking just short of an energy-sapping two hours to beat Harinder Pal Sandhu (IND) 3-2 in the round of 32 on Thursday night, and the first rally lasted for more than a minute.

Back in May a couple hundred of them arrived in Washington, vowing to maintain a daily protest until Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, Harry Reid, and Nancy Pelosi were forced to abandon their offices . They were mighty, even if they didn’t quite make the 10 million to 30 million attendance mark they’d predicted. But they did at least get Obama to resign, didn’t they? Oh, and Eric Holder. Better arrest Holder, just to be sure he can’t sneak back in. Fast and Furious! ObamaCare! BENGHAZI!!! It was going pretty well for a couple of days. They prayed in front of the Lincoln Memorial, they flew their flags by the Washington Monument, they yelled their demands at the White House. They settled into a shady spot by a snack shack on the National Mall within view of the Capitol and Camp Liberty was born. And parked at the edge of their patch of grass was a black RV covered in Anonymous and WikiLeaks logos with an OCCUPY flag flying from the back. The first time we noticed it there was a woman in a flowing tunic standing between the skylights, blowing a duck call. Meet Christine, God-Appointed Sheriff of Washington, DC. Christine came for Operation American Spring because she wants to overthrow the federal government, but some of her other causes didn’t line up too well with the majority of OAS protesters. She’s a vocal supporter of Chelsea Manning, Julian Assange, and Edward Snowden, she thinks Osama bin Laden’s assassination was a hoax, and she has a large web presence dedicated to the theory that the 9/11 attacks were orchestrated by the George W. Bush administration. To keep the peace, she tried covering the WikiLeaks logos on one side of the bus, which she calls the Anonomobile. Then her fellow protesters asked her to stop telling passers-by that a passenger jet couldn’t have made a hole that small in the Pentagon and that the damage to the building was inflicted by a missile. Christian fellowship seemed to keep things calm for awhile, but after about a month, Camp Liberty was down to a few dozen diehards and Christine’s small faction felt increasingly unwelcome. A shoving match between the Anonomobile’s resident A/V expert Media Matt and OAS pastor  Sylvester Bland (seen above, with flag) brought out the Park Police, and Christine began to suspect that the people who’d taken charge of the “leaderless movement” were either secretly government contractors or only interested skimming donations coming in through the project’s various web pages. She was determined to protest in favor of government transparency in view of the Capitol and the throngs of tourists passing by on the National Mall, but the ideological and personal disputes with OAS boiled over and even a shared commitment to taking down Barack Obama could not bridge the gap. She moved the Anonomobile closer to the Capitol as the population of Camp Liberty dwindled to zero and its spiritual father, Col. Riley, declared that the protest had “made a difference” and that he was resigning as its leader. Obama remains in the White House, so Christine and Media Matt remain on the Mall. They spend their time engaging the public, tweeting , posting frequent public Facebook updates , and filling her YouTube channel with videos about the importance of net neutrality , how hard it is to walk into the Department of Justice for no reason, the aftermath of the “Kenyan Occupation” on the Mall (also known as the Smithsonian Folklife Festival ), and the utterly prejudicial ticketing habits of the Park Police. Since Anonymous avoids naming leaders or spokespeople, it doesn’t exactly have a VP in charge of franchising. If you want to paint your RV with Anonymous symbols, name it the Anonomobile, and drive it to protests to promote Anonymous, no one’s going to stop you, but some of the Anonokids might not be too happy about it. They might be mad enough to fire up the ol’ text-to-voice and take to YouTube to say you are almost definitely probably an FBI informant. Probably. Is Christine a covert agent? We cannot say! We do not have these Friends with Access to Information. She has always been quite cordial to us, and the closest she comes to a disguise is doubling up on her hippie accessories to appear harmless to the police protecting the government she’s vowed to dismantle . Well, I guess you could say she’s kind of in disguise when she puts on the mask. It’s hard to call her covert, especially when she uses the bullhorn to remind the complacent public that “HACKTIVISM IS SELF-DEFENSE.” Christine says she’s staying in DC until November, waiting not for the midterm elections but for the Anonymous Million Mask March, commemorating the attack on Parliament  on November 5, 1605. Her call for revolution continues 71 days after Operation American Spring first arrived, and she can almost always be found with her Anonomobile and Media Matt parked on the National Mall between 3rd and 7th Streets, NW. Chances are she’ll offer you a drink of water and invite you inside to sit for awhile in her soothing blue oasis to escape the disgusting heat of the DC summer. She’s nice like that. Just don’t be offended if she’s got some stuff to do. Beth will be live-tweeting the revolution from the food court of the  Air & Space Museum.     Related video Tagged anonomobile ,  anonymous ,  god-appointed sheriff ,  hacktivism ,  occupation ,  operation american spring ,  pastor bland ,  pt one woman army ,  tea party ,  wikileaks", "score"=>156.48192, "summaryTitle"=>"God-Appointed Sheriff Lady Will Defend America From President Obama Bin Laden Her Own Self", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"Remember Operation American Spring?

Discussions are believed to have taken place between the clubs, although the Gunners are yet to formalise their offer for the 19-year-old. Sources have indicated that is likely to happen soon, though, and the Daily Echo understands Saints have agreed to enter into the talks as the sum of money being spoken about represents a huge amount for a teenager who has just one season of first-team football under his belt. The club also have Nathaniel Clyne in place, with the two players having split time almost equally at right-back last term. Saints have been aware that they will, at some stage, need to make a long-term decision over who to proceed with in that position. However, if they do agree to sell, there is no doubt that Chambers would be a big loss, having emerged as one of the brightest right-back talents in the country. Petersfield-born Chambers, who has been with the club since the age of seven, is under contract at St Mary’s until 2017, having signed a new four-year deal last summer. The teenager made his Premier League debut on the opening day of last season, helping Saints to a 1-0 win at West Brom.

The law is states you have a right to defend yourself when you feel threatened. If someone strikes you and you feel like you are in danger, you are within your rights to strike back.

I understand what Stephen A. is saying, I think he could have just presented it in a much clearer and precise way. In his attempts to make it sound politically correct, it just made it sound a lot worse than what his actual point was. I don’t watch First Take, but I hope they gave Cari Champion an opportunity to speak, seeing that she is a woman and I would love to hear her take on the subject.

So I am not at all surprised at what is boosting tourism on Martha’s Vineyard this summer. Whether it thrills you or scares you a recently released study from the the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that great white shark populations are rising along the East Coast of Canada and the United States. And it’s doing wonders for tourism! Now don’t get all panicked about hitting your favorite Cape Cod or Martha’s Vineyard beach this season. Before 2004, two shark sightings a year were the norm, so even three sightings is considered a rise in populations. But if you are a shark fanatic, or just a fan of Jaws , you like hundreds of others this summer may be heading for the Vineyard! With the area’s tie in to Steven Spielberg ‘s iconic movie, tourists looking for sharks are heading here to see them. And really who wouldn’t want to actually see a shark off the island’s shores!?! But it’s not just the beaches getting better business. Once the tourists make their vacation plans the entire area benefits from their spending. Hotels, restaurants, bars and more reap the rewards.

Even Bill Nye “the Science Guy,” in...", "content"=>"I’m shocked at the countless hundreds of millions of dollars that have been spent over the years in the desperate and fruitless search for extraterrestrial life. Even Bill Nye “the Science Guy,” in our recent debate, happily gloated about tax dollars being spent toward this effort. And now, secular scientists are at it again. Of course, secularists are desperate to find life in outer space, as they believe that would provide evidence that life can evolve in different locations and given the supposed right conditions!  The search for extraterrestrial life is really driven by man’s rebellion against God in a desperate attempt to supposedly prove evolution! A UK news site recently reported, “Aliens are out there. We’ll find a new earth within 20 years.” Recent technologies have developed new space telescopes that will be used to study exoplanets (planets orbiting other stars) with the hope of discovering habitable, earth-like worlds that might contain life—at least that is what they hope for! You see, according to the secular, evolutionary worldview there must be other habited worlds out there. As the head of NASA, Charles Borden, puts it, “It’s highly improbable in the limitless vastness of the universe that we humans stand alone.” Secularists cannot allow earth to be special or unique—that’s a biblical idea (Isaiah 45:18). If life evolved here, it simply must have evolved elsewhere they believe. The Bible, in sharp contrast to the secular worldview, teaches that earth was specially created, that it is unique and the focus of God’s attention (Isaiah 66:1 and Psalm 115:16). Life did not evolve but was specially created by God, as Genesis clearly teaches. Christians certainly shouldn’t expect alien life to be cropping up across the universe. (There are other theological problems with intelligent alien life that you can read about here ) Now the Bible doesn’t say whether there is or is not animal or plant life in outer space.  I certainly suspect not. The Earth was created for human life. And the sun and moon  were created for signs and our seasons—and to declare the glory of God. And I do believe there can’t be other intelligent beings in outer space because of the meaning of the gospel. You see, the Bible makes it clear that Adam’s sin affected the whole universe. This means that any aliens would also be affected by Adam’s sin, but because they are not Adam’s descendants, they can’t have salvation. One day, the whole universe will be judged by fire, and there will be a new heavens and earth. God’s Son stepped into history to be Jesus Christ, the “Godman,” to be our relative, and to be the perfect sacrifice for sin—the Savior of mankind. Jesus did not become the “GodKlingon” or the “GodMartian”!  Only descendants of Adam can be saved.  God’s Son remains the “Godman” as our Savior.  In fact, the Bible makes it clear that we see the Father through the Son (and we see the Son through His Word).  To suggest that aliens could respond to the gospel is just totally wrong. An understanding of the gospel makes it clear that salvation through Christ is only for the Adamic race—human beings who are all descendants of Adam. Many secularists want to discover alien life hoping that aliens can answer the deepest questions of life: “Where did we come from?” and “What is the purpose and meaning of life?” But such people are ignoring the revelation from the infinite God behind the whole universe. The Creator has told us where we came from: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1; Nehemiah 9:6). And He told us what life’s purpose is: “Fear God and keep His commandments” (Ecclesiastes 12:13). The answers to life’s questions will not be found in imaginary aliens but in the revelation of the Creator through the Bible and His Son, Jesus Christ, who came to die on a Cross to redeem mankind from sin and death that our ancestor, Adam, introduced. We need to start proclaiming the authority of God’s Word from the very first verse—even on the subject of alien life! For more information on the supposed existence of ETs and other common questions about a biblical worldview, I encourage you to order The New Answers Book series  from our bookstore. Or for witnessing purposes, we have a booklet that can be ordered in bulk with special pricing to help teach people the truth about aliens and UFOs and promote the gospel for your local church or youth programs.

Monica Ramirez, who was believed to have been kidnapped in Champaign on June 11 and taken to Houston, allegedly lied to investigators in an attempt to hide from her friends and family that she wanted to be with her ex-boyfriend in Houston, according to a press release from U.S. Attorney Jim Lewis. Ramirez, 19, and her two hoax kidnappers — Eduardo G. Cortez, 25, of Houston, and Jarbey E. Reyes, 18, of Champaign — appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge David Bernthal in Urbana on Friday. The three remain in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, and the two men are being held on a detainer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If convicted, they could each face up to five years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines for concealing a material fact in connection with the interstate kidnapping. The charges follow a monthlong investigation by the Champaign Police Department, the FBI in Springfield and Houston, the Champaign County State's Attorney and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations. According to the complaint, Ramirez allegedly lied to investigators about designing her own kidnapping. She wanted to be with her ex-boyfriend Cortez, investigators alleged, but wanted to hide her consent from her family and current boyfriend. She was with her current boyfriend, Alexander Aburto, 22, of Urbana, on June 11 at Market Place Mall when they were approached shortly after 4 p.m. by three men, two of whom were later identified as Cortez and Reyes. The identity of the third man has not been made public. Reyes allegedly held a knife to Aburto's throat while the others allegedly forced Ramirez into a pickup truck. Reyes also allegedly slashed the tires on Aburto's vehicle before they drove off with Ramirez. Cortez and Ramirez were found in Houston three days later. Ramirez maintained the lie in fear of losing custody of her child, according to the federal complaint. Reyes, who listed an address in the first block of Rain Tree Drive, Champaign, is also due for another court appearance in September in Champaign County Circuit Court, where he is charged with aggravated battery and armed kidnapping, a class X felony. Cortez, of Houston, is due for a circuit court appearance on Aug. 5 for aggravated battery.", "score"=>156.20644, "summaryTitle"=>"Woman accused of faking her own kidnapping | News-Gazette.com", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"URBANA — A woman who was said to have been kidnapped at Market Place Mall in June was complicit in the scheme and in fact devised the hoax with her alleged kidnappers, a federal prosecutor said on Friday.", "cities"=>"us-il", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2014-07-25/woman-accused-faking-her-own-kidnapping.html", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "t.co", "direct"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1jZUJ8B", "lastseen"=>"20140726004708", "page"=>"http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2014-07-25/woman-accused-faking-her-own-kidnapping.html"}, {"domain"=>"radiobiafra.co", "initial_epoch"=>"1406308325000", "h2"=>["Topics of Today", "Don’t run away stay so that we can kill you through Boko Haram Kwankwaso begs southerners in Kano."], "h3"=>["Add comment", "Should we hire purchase RB Transmitter or not?"], "site"=>"radiobiafra.co", "lastindexed"=>"20140726004603", "keywords"=>"Radio Biafra, Ndi Igbo, Ndigbo, Biafra, Nigeria, Biafra War,Igbo People, Ibo, Anambra, Enugu, Imo, Abia, Delta, Ebonyi, Ojukwu, Achebe, Zik, Uwazulike", "last_indexed_epoch"=>"1406335563403", "title"=>"Radio Biafra - Don’t run away stay so that we can kill you through Boko Haram Kwankwaso begs southerners in Kano.", "initial"=>"20140725171205", "summaryText"=>"Kano state governor, Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso has declared that the two week ultimatum given to Southerners in Kano to leave the state, by a non-governmental organization, Northern Youth Development Foundation, is null and void. “No one has the authority", "content"=>"Kano state governor, Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso has declared that the two week ultimatum given to Southerners in Kano to leave the state, by a non-governmental organization, Northern Youth Development Foundation, is null and void. “No one has the authority to sack you from this place. Kano is your home and you have come to stay”, the governor stressed.  Kwankwaso stated this when Kano state Non Indigenes Forum paid him a courtesy call at Government House, Kano, pointing out that his government does not support the call as it will result in acrimony, thus, not in the best interest of Nigerians. He said the allegation that the administration of Gov. Rochas Okorocha of Imo state planned to take measures aimed at returning Northerners in his states to their states of origin is false as the Imo state governor, being a detribalized Nigerian with substantial investments in the North could not initiate such a policy. “I am sure Owelle Okorocha’s investments in the North outweigh the investments by Northerners in Imo state put together. Look at even the Rochas Foundation School he built here and other investments. Such intention about driving away people from his state could not have come from him”. “I have personally spoken to Rochas and he openly and candidly told me that the there was nothing like that and the news was the handiwork of detractors who never wish him well” Kwankwaso added. Gov. Kwankwaso, however, called on federal government to avoid measures aimed at worsening ethnic, sectional and religious discord among Nigerians, alleging that President Jonathan is creating unnecessary political tension in the country, which is harmful to national interests. “Tension caused by the government is probably the worst tension; we have cases where governors are worried and concerned either about their security of lives and properties or security of their jobs so also other elected officials as well as businessmen and women across the country,” he lamented. Earlier, leader of the delegation, Dr. Jimpat Aiyelangbe said they were at the governor’s office to lodge complaint over a letter sent to them by a group of youth asking non indigenes to leave the state within two weeks. Dr. Aiyelangbe lamented that since the letter was delivered to the, they have being having sleepless nights, noting that if government does not takes appropriate action on time things could get out of hand.

The head of Volkswagen Group design has confirmed to TopGear.com that work on the next Bugatti model is well underway, with an expected launch in early 2016. Walter de Silva, who has headed up VW Group’s design since 2007, said “we’re working hard at Bugatti, but don’t worry, it’s coming. I cannot predict exactly, but at the end of 2015 or early 2016, we’ll see the new Bugatti.” De Silva wouldn’t confirm exactly what form this new car would take, but did concede that it “won’t be a Veyron replacement, it’ll be more than that. We’re investigating all avenues at the moment”. He remained confident, however, it will be something incredible. “For me, Bugatti is not a car,” de Silva said, “it is a piece of art. You have to understand this. You are in another range when you talk about Bugatti. No, forget that, you play in another  league  with Bugatti. When you buy a Bugatti, you buy a piece of art. It’s a story, and I would like to transfer the Bugatti idea in this way.” Tech-wise, again, de Silva remained tight-lipped, but did say how the company is putting “a lot of attention in the technology for the new Bugatti. We’re developing a few different concepts at the moment, working together with the engineers and designers at the same time. “Bugatti is something that in the end is a car, OK, but it’s a car that is a lifestyle. Bugatti is a part of your sensitivity, of your feeling,” de Silva added. So what do we know, then? Earlier this year, Bugatti boss Dr Wolfgang Schreiber  told Top Gear that the company would not build a ‘SuperVeyron’ or indeed a production version of the 2009 Galibier concept (pictured above) .   “We have talked many, many times about the Galibier, but this car will not come because it would confuse our customers,” Dr Schreiber told us. “With the Veyron, we placed Bugatti on top of all super sportscar brands in the whole world.

JOSEPH COUNTY - A man police captured last year after seven years on the run was found guilty by a jury Thursday for child molesting. Terry Wayne Waugh, 30, was arrested at a motel in Steuben County back in November of last year after evading several child molesting charges for seven years. Court documents show Waugh was charged for molesting a child over a period of almost two years. The child was between the ages of nine and 11-years-old. A jury found Waugh guilty of four counts of Child Molesting. Sentencing has been scheduled for August 20. The following is a release from the St. Joseph County Prosecutor's Office: St. Joseph County - Late yesterday evening, after approximately five hours of deliberation, a jury found Terry Wayne Waugh, Jr., 30, guilty of 1 count of Child Molesting, a Class A Felony, and 2 counts of Child Molesting, each a Class C Felony. The sentencing range for a Class A Felony is 20 to 50 years. The sentencing range for a Class C Felony is 2 to 8 years. Waugh's sentencing is scheduled for August 20,2014, at 10:30 a.m. before Judge Frese. Waugh was charged on July 14, 2005, with: Count I: Child Molesting, a class C felony Count II: Child Molesting, a class C felony Count III: Child Molesting, a class A felony Count IV: Child Molesting, a class B felony Waugh was charged for molesting B.D. over a period from June 1, 2003, to May 11, 2005. B.D., during this time period, was between nine and eleven years old. Terry Waugh was the brother of B.D.'s mother's boyfriend. A bench warrant was ordered issued by the Court on January 5,2007, when Waugh failed to appear for a hearing in this matter. Waugh was arrested November 16,2013, by Indiana State Police and the U.S. Marshal Service on this warrant in Steuben County, Indiana. Waugh was subsequently transported back to St. Joseph County to stand trial in this matter. The jury issued a verdict of \"Not Guilty\" on Count IV, Child Molesting, a Class B Felony, and the Court entered a judgment of acquittal on this count. During the two years (June 2003 to May 2005) that Waugh molested B.D., Waugh turned 21 years old. Count IV was charged as deviate sexual conduct committed by a person at least eighteen years of age but less than 21 years of age on a child less than fourteen years of age. Count III was charged as deviate sexual conduct committed by a person at least twenty-one years of age on a child less than fourteen years of age. Thus, Count III and IV encompassed the same acts, but Waugh was charged as being of different ages at the time the acts were committed.", "score"=>156.14287, "summaryTitle"=>"Man captured after 7 years on the run found guilty of child molesting", "type"=>"search", "description"=>"A man police captured last year after seven years on the run was found guilty by a jury Thursday for child molesting.", "cities"=>"us-in", "lang"=>"en", "url"=>"http://www.wsbt.com/news/local/man-captured-after-7-years-on-the-run-found-guilty-of-child-molesting/27150572", "referrer"=>["facebook.com", "wsbt.com", "t.co", "direct", "justthewayilikeit.info"], "aggregate_link"=>"http://bit.ly/1jZJm0y", "lastseen"=>"20140725235437", "page"=>"http://www.wsbt.com/news/local/man-captured-after-7-years-on-the-run-found-guilty-of-child-molesting/27150572", "ogtitle"=>"Man captured after 7 years on the run found guilty of child molesting"}, {"domain"=>"1023blakefm.com", "initial_epoch"=>"1406325657000", "h2"=>["Parmalee Drop Summertime Video for ‘Close Your Eyes’", "Desperate Woman Out of Ideas Strips to Avoid Car Being Towed", "Garth Brooks Confirms Six More Dates in Chicago for ‘The Garth Experience’", "Sleeping With Your Cell Phone Can Be a Fire Hazard"], "h3"=>["HUGE thank you to all of the gorgeous women who participated in the contest.

Instead of a typical mirror that shows you exactly how you see yourself, this mirror would show you the opposite: how the world sees you. It would not only show you your strengths and your weaknesses, but the specific differences that make people value you, hire you, champion you and respect you. Now even though this mirror doesn’t exist, there is something out there that’s eerily similar. Enter: The Fascination Advantage™, the first personality test that measures what makes someone most engaging to others. This week on Office Hours, we got the chance to chat with the creator of The Fascination Advantage™, Sally Hogshead. Sally is also a speaker, consultant and author of two books, including her brand new book out July 1st, ” How the World Sees You: Discover Your Highest Value Through the Science of Fascination .” By using this book, and the quick test, you can easily find out which of 49 different personality archetypes you are. Are you The Talent? The Victor? The Archer? Each personality archetype focuses on your primary advantage and your secondary advantage, which help describe your personality and how you add value to the world. By being aware of these different advantages, Sally says you can begin to reach your fullest potential. “Your personality archetype lights the way to how you’re going to be your most successful,” she says. She dives further into these 49 archetypes in her  new book  and also shares seven different truths about how the world sees you. Sally discussed one of these truths with us, sharing that the greatest value you can add to the world is to become more of yourself . ”When you own your differences, that’s when you are going to reach your ultimate potential,” Sally says. She explains that you shouldn’t change who you are, but rather become more of who you are by focusing on your uniqueness and what makes you valuable to other people. “You don’t have to find the light, you are the light. When you let your personality shine, you light up the world,” she says. Levo is joining Sally to help you find your light through this easy and fun personality test! Is your primary advantage innovation? Is your secondary advantage passion?

Photo courtesy of Vertex Effects What could be better than having “true” bypass in your pedal? This sounds like an indisputably good idea, but in fact, it’s not that simple. The subject has been written about before, but there is such confusion regarding true bypass that it’s helpful to revisit it from time to time. When it comes to preserving optimum tone, how you bypass and wire your pedals can be as important as how you power your pedal. (For more on this topic, see “Powering Your Board” in the December 2011 issue.) Let’s take a look at how both true bypass and buffered bypass work. The idea of true bypass is that when your pedal or effect is off, there are no electronic components whatsoever touching— and thereby having an influence on—your guitar signal. This sounds great in theory, but there are some practical problems with the approach. In almost all cases, guitar pickups are passive, high-impedance devices with a relatively wimpy ability to drive a signal. Think of it as a trickling stream of water rather than a pressurized pipe. It’s very easy to divert a trickling stream with a few small rocks, but not so easy to place those rocks in a high pressure pipe without them simply being blown out. Because the signal coming out of a guitar is weak and easily influenced, even the wire in your cables and true-bypass circuits can degrade your tone. The degradation you may hear will manifest itself as a loss of high frequencies—or “tone suck,” as many refer to it. This is caused when a simple low-pass (treble cut) filter is created with a passive RC circuit. The “R”, or resistor, is the combined resistance of all the cabling in your rig. The “C”, or capacitor, is the inherent capacitance present in shielded cables. Each true-bypass circuit adds unbuffered cable length—and therefore more resistance and capacitance to the signal path—so they create an unintentional low-pass filter. Another problem is that the 3PDT footswitches commonly used in true-bypass circuits are not optimized to switch low-voltage signals like guitar pickups. The side effect of this can be noise or pops when switching in and out of bypass. The physical distance between the input and output jacks and the switch can also exacerbate this switching noise, in addition to adding internal cable length. A better way to accomplish true bypass is to use a relay that’s optimized for switching small signals. Such relays can be quieter and placed in an optimum location in the pedal that minimizes cable length when the pedal is bypassed. The other way that pedal manufacturers implement bypass circuits is, of course, with solid-state electronics. This is often done with FET switching circuits and is called buffered bypass or analog bypass. A simple truth that escapes many is that any pedal with active electronics in it automatically and by its very nature will include a buffer. Now, the quality of that buffer can vary greatly from manufacturer to manufacturer, but when buffered bypass is done well, it can be a very good method of bypassing a pedal. It provides a robust and relatively silent form of switching. Buffered bypass has simply gotten a bad name over the years because of poorly designed buffered bypass circuits that color your tone. Because of this, and for fear of any extraneous electronics hanging on to their guitar signals when bypassed, many players insist on only using pedals with true bypass. Players who use batteries in their pedals also have to worry that once the battery dies, not even the dry-bypass signal will pass through the pedal because it requires power to do so. One drawback of buffered-bypass circuits is that pedals not using low-noise components and designs can add a significant amount of white noise to the signal chain even when the pedal is bypassed. This can usually be minimized with a correctly designed bypass circuit. So, what’s a pedal junkie to do? There is, in fact, a best-of-both-worlds solution: Place a good quality buffer at the beginning of your pedalboard signal chain. This can be in the form of a compact dedicated buffer, a clean boost set to unity gain, or even a pedal with a high-quality integrated buffer that you don’t mind leaving on all the time. In my personal rig, I leave an optical compressor set to a very light compression level on all the time, and it serves as my up-front buffer. What the buffer does is transform the trickling stream that is your guitar signal into a pressurized fire hose of a low-impedance signal. This significantly minimizes any degradation that can be caused by having many true-bypass pedals or lots of cable in your rig. Having a buffer up front becomes extremely important when using a true-bypass “looper,” a device that bypasses effects externally with multiple true-bypass effects loops. In practice, those devices add a ton of extra cable to your rig. Again, a buffer up front will minimize any harm they can potentially do and let you take full advantage of true bypass. In short, put a buffer first in the chain, trust your ears, and rid yourself of bypass anxiety. Happy shredding!

Having a smaller waistline cuts your risks of heart disease, diabetes type 2, and other health problems. Check out these 25 tummy-shrinking tips—including some quick fixes for fitting into those skinny jeans tonight. At the gym Training . Women who hit the gym and watch calorie intake reduced ab fat-cell size by about 18%, making them more successful at tummy trimming than those who just dieted, according to a Wake Forest University study. The more weight-bearing the exercise, the more calories torched from your midsection. So walk, run, or add some jump roping to your usual routine. Research in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that women who did full-body strength-training twice a week decreased overall body fat and didn’t gain as much ab fat as those who didn’t. Work in intervals. Women who did 20 minutes of interval training three times a week lost more belly fat than women who logged 40 minutes of moderate cardio three times a week, according to an Australian study. Crunch time . Doing crunches? Pull in your abs before curling up to work your muscles twice as hard. Do the bicycle to target other ab muscles (crunches work only the rectus abdominus, aka your six-pack): Lie with your hands behind your head; alternate touching each elbow to the opposite knee. Don’t neglect your midback muscles (the lats). They work with your core to help you stand straighter, minimizing your pooch. Try Lat Rows: Bend at the waist and hold a dumbbell in each hand; bend elbows and pull weights up until elbows are level with torso. To really challenge your abs, crank out crunches on a stability ball. You’ll engage more muscles than you will doing traditional crunches, according to a study published in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research. At the bar Watch your brew. Beer drinkers have the highest waist-to-hip ratios of those who have six or more drinks a week, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill research says. Have a little wine. Light to moderate wine drinking can protect against ab poundage, some studies suggest. But …sip just one daily glass of vino or other alcoholic beverage—more will build your belly instead. Before a big event Avoid carbonation. Fizzy drinks are full of gas—and you will be, too, if you drink them. The result? A not-so-svelte profile. Cut back on energy drinks. Your body turns sugary, caffeine-laden drinks into fat faster than caffeine-free ones, spelling danger for your waistline, one New Zealand researcher notes. Don’t sip through a straw —you’ll swallow extra air, which will show up on your middle. Pass on the gum. Not only can chewing it make you swallow air, but sugar alcohols in sugar-free gum and mints can cause a blown-up belly. At the table: Choices matter Eat well, eat more. Women in the Framingham Nutrition Studies who ate 360 more calories of healthier foods per day were less prone to ab fat than those who ate fewer calories, more saturated fat, and less fiber. Obese adults who cut calories and increase whole-grain intake zapped more tummy pooch than those who stuck to refined grains, Penn State researchers found. Pick lean protein. Moderate servings—about 40% of your daily calories—in your diet may lead to overall weight loss, particularly in the tummy, a study from Skidmore College reveals. Research out of Spain shows that a diet rich in monounsaturated fats, like a Mediterranean diet, can prevent belly fat. Up your calcium. Dieters who got 1,200 to 1,300 milligrams of daily calcium saw three times the belly trimming as those consuming the same calories but less calcium, University of Tennessee researchers said. Get your daily dose from yogurt, rather than other dairy sources or supplements; its calcium may help whittle your middle, an International Journal of Obesity study points out. But … Choose yogurt wisely. Rats who ate saccharin-sweetened yogurt gained more weight and body fat—including around the waistline—than those who ate sugar-sweetened yogurt, Purdue University researchers found. Get your C. Women who took in 56 milligrams or less per day (the recommended dietary allowance is 60 mg) were more likely to accumulate belly fat than those who got 57 mg or more, a Journal of Public Health Nutrition study found. At the table: Do’s and Don’ts Enjoy soy. Women sipping soy shakes every day for three months didn’t add any midlife fat to their middles, according to research from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Ban trans-fat. Monkeys who got much of their dietary fat from trans fats had 30% more belly flab than those who ate more monounsaturated fats, a Wake Forest University study found. Go easy on fiber. Too much can leave you bloated. Aim for at least 20 grams per day, but add it to your diet gradually, and be sure to pair it with plenty of H2O. In your life Try Pilates. According to a Greek study, these exercises significantly improve posture—and that naturally minimizes a pooch. Move! A Duke University study showed that a couch-potato lifestyle resulted in an 11.6% increase in deep-belly fat in women over eight months. Another reason to stop smoking: Nicotine keeps abs from burning fat, so smokers often have more deep-tissue belly fat. Relax. Women with the largest waistlines also reported the highest stress levels, possibly due to the production of the stress hormone cortisol, Yale University research showed. Get more sleep.

From a script by Kevin Smith . Which was based on the iconic “Death of Superman” comic book storyline. And then it all fell apart, transforming it into one of Hollywood’s greatest “What if?” narratives. ‘Superman Lives’ may have died before making it in front of cameras, but at least the new documentary ‘The Death of Superman Lives’ will give us an insider’s look at what went wrong. Although the trailer itself is total amateur hour (they really, really need to hire a proper editor and sound mixer), the footage itself looks like it’ll be crack for superhero movie fans. The video not only teases interviews with Burton and Smith, but sit-downs with artists, costumes designers and countless other people who worked on the project. Even more exciting is the amount of crazy concept art on display. Even more exciting than that is the test footage of Cage in the Superman costume, which looks, uh … well, it looks different. There are plenty of great ‘Superman Lives’ stories floating around the internet (particularly from the ever-talkative Smith), but that test footage alone is going make this a must-see. Sometimes, the only thing more interesting than a finished movie is an unfinished movie that could have forever altered the course of an entire genre. What would the superhero movie look like today if ‘Superman Lives’ got off the ground? That’s a great question!

Ladies and lashes listen up! Your eyes are one of the most unique features on your face and one of the first things anybody notices, so why not make the most of them? Eyes are the windows of your face, and eyelashes the window-dressing. Making the most of your eyelashes is one of the easiest ways to glam up your makeup and draw attention to your eyes. There are many ways to do this, either by making the most of your natural lashes, or adding fake lashes. I spoke with hair and make up artist Lexis Monfort, as well as Founder/COO of Velour Lashes, Angela Tran, to get some insight into the fake lash trend, along with some tips, tricks, pros and cons of false lashes, straight from the professionals who use them. Au Naturel: Your own Lashes   There are many advantages to working with your natural lashes… and there’s no reason they can’t be as perfect as they were the day you were born! Sometimes being organic and natural is most beautiful of all— and it is easy and quick. If you want to emphasize your lashes without resorting to falsies, there are several ways to do so! Fabulous Mascara I love Maybelline One by One Volume Express , $8.15 for adding fullness and length. Curl Away! Don’t forget to use a good eyelash curler before you put on your mascara –it might seem unnecessary, but you will soon realize the difference! Try this simple  Sephora Curler , $17 for maximum pop. Adding Length & Strength If you don’t think your natural lashes stand on their own and you don’t want to use false ones, try a lash supplement treatment like Latisse to help length and fullness. Do-It-Yourself Fake Lashes If you’d like some help from falsies, but don’t know where to start – don’t be scared! Although seemingly difficult at first, false lashes are an easy way to get that superstar look with minimal effort. There are many types you can choose from! Don’t forget to check out our tips & tricks for applying fake lashes at the bottom of this article. Strip Lashes If you’d like more of a dramatic look, go for a full strip lash. Be sure to note that this type of lash can look “fake,” so always make sure to apply eyeliner to your eye before applying the lashes—this helps them blend in with your natural lashes. Also, add a lick of mascara to your eyelashes before adding the strip, and after, to help them blend. My favorite natural-looking strip lashes are Ardell Lashes . Ardell lashes are an authentic and affordable option for any occasion day or night.   As a performer, my favorite lashes for a dramatic look on stage are Red Cherry . These can be used for costumes as well as a fun night out and are extremely affordable and versatile.  Cluster or Flare Lashes Cluster, or flare, lashes are smaller strip lashes normally used in the outside corner of your eye for added drama. Opt for cluster lashes or flares if you want the ease of a strip lash, but the more natural subtle look of individual lashes. Apply them only on the outer part of your lid or wherever you feel you need more fullness in your lash. Once you master this technique you can easily do them by yourself at home for any occasion and you don’t even need eyeliner! I love Ardell Accents for a wallet-friendly option! Individual Lashes Individual fake lashes can be daunting to the non-makeup artist, but they are a fabulous option for a natural look. They are easy to apply once you get the hang of it – basically apply glue to the tip of the lashes and place at various points along your eyelid, where your natural lashes meet the lid. They give fullness and length, without the strip-like quality. I love  Ardell Individuals . A good tutorial video (by Lisa Eldridge) for applying these can be seen here: Mink Eyelashes There are several types of synthetic lashes on the market, but Mink lashes are the new trend taking us by storm. Many celebrities and performers love the soft, genuine look that Mink lashes have. They are, of course, never tested on animals and purely made from mink sheddings. This is definitely a more costly option but a fabulous way to get that very natural look. Mink fur offers a glamorous shine and a soft feathery feel. Velour lashes   are a great option for an every day look or a night out on the town.  Professionally-Applied Lashes Individual Eyelash Extensions For a semi long-term (and more extreme) option, try individual eyelash extensions. Eyelash extensions are a little trickier than strips or individuals and should always be applied by a professional. These tend to get pricey so this may be a last resort option that is more permanent as they can last anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 months with proper maintenance. Depending on what types of lashes you use, eyelash extensions give you a very natural full look, which can shorten your time getting ready (you don’t even need to apply mascara!) The application process is time consuming however and can take up to 2 hours to apply properly. The Glues There are many different types of glue you can use for applying fake lashes at home—some last mere hours, and some last days. Here are our favorites: Strip Lashes. For strip lashes, you want a lighter glue, so that you can remove the strip lashes before you sleep. Duo , $8, is a great option for glue that lasts the night. Individual Lashes. For individual lashes, you can have a stronger glue, as it is not along the entire strip of your eye, but focused into tiny points. I love Ardell Lashgrip glue. Tips & Tricks for Applying Fake Lashes Trim. For strip lashes, measure the length of the lashes to your eye shape and trim the outer end, if necessary.  This is very easy—just snip off the last few lashes if the strip is too long! Apply eyeliner to your lid. This will help blend the false lash line in with your natural lashes. Bend them. Bend the strip lashes in a U shape to help curve them to your eye before applying the glue. Look down . If you have trouble applying lashes straight on, as your eye needs to be half closed, take a mirror and set it on a flat surface that you can look over into. Glue with ease. You can either squeeze the glue directly onto the strip with a steady hand or with a toothpick or similar tool. Wait. Wait about 10 seconds for the glue to become slightly sticky before applying the lashes to your eye. Apply at the base. Apply the lash as close to the base of your natural lash line as you can, not on top of your eyelid. Most glues dry clear so don’t worry if you get some on your lid. Blend. Apply mascara to the lashes to help blend in the false lashes with your natural ones. Have fun! —————– A big thanks to Lexis Monfort for these fabulous tips and tricks!

Ebola victims were being released from the hospital, completely recovered. They were healthy and even given certificates signed by health authorities stating that they could safely return to normal life. We knew that there would be a few survivors, but the initial days of the outbreak were grim enough to turn most optimists into cynics. Talk of very high mortality rates; a rapid spread of the virus to the capital and beyond the borders in neighboring countries; and a palpable fear on the streets zapped the psychic energy of us who live and work here. But there they were: people, weak and squinting in the bright sunlight but healthy, emerging from isolation wards. And not just the lucky few we expected, but more than 30 per cent of those infected were surviving. The story in the media quickly turned to the stigmatization of these people. Journalists talked about how they were not welcome at work, school, even at home, but for many the stigma passed quickly and still others were welcomed back, almost immediately, into their old lives. UNICEF sat down with an Ebola survivor, one of the earlier cases in the country – Kadiatou*. She met us on a main street in Conakry and walked us back to her home, through scores of children playing football on muddy roads. We sat on plastic chairs in a circle while her mother hung the laundry behind us. “I have no idea where I got Ebola,” she said as she chewed on a sachet of ready-to-use therapeutic food—as part of her post-Ebola treatment. Ready-to-use therapeutic food is normally provided by UNICEF as life-saving emergency nutrition to the thousands of children here who suffer from severe acute malnutrition. Ebola victims lose a lot of nutrients and fluids as a result of vomiting and diarrhea and the ready-to-use therapeutic food help them regain their strength. “I am a medical student, and in my work, I encounter many sick people.” Kadiatou’s initial symptoms were pretty typical of many illnesses—a sudden onset, pounding headache and high fever, followed by vomiting and diarrhea. Her knowledge as a medical student probably prevented Kadiatou from spreading Ebola to those caring for her. “When my Aunt would clean up my vomit, I insisted that she wash her hands with bleach.” As part of our response UNICEF has distributed many of the materials families are using to protect their family members, including over 350,000 bottles of chlorine, almost one million bars of soap, and materials for disinfecting hospital rooms and victims’ homes. A few days after Kadiatou tested positive for Ebola she was sent directly to the isolation ward in Donka hospital. The isolation center was busy. Families brought food to their sick relatives. And, “there were many journalists.” “In the beginning we were all in the same room. But as patients improved, they were separated from those who weren’t as fortunate. I first knew I was going to survive when I saw a patient recovering. I thought, ‘maybe it is possible for me too’. For the first few days, I was desperate. I drank a lot of mineral water and had infusions…maybe it helped me to survive.” After what must have seemed like an eternity for her, but in real time was a matter of weeks, Kadiatou was given new clothes, a certificate declaring her healthy, and was sent home. We asked her about the widely reported stigma that affected survivors. “When I went back to school, some of my friends avoided me, but it’s getting better. People don’t believe that I had Ebola because they can’t believe I survived.” Of course, Kadiatou is aware that Ebola is real. But UNICEF remains vigilant in keeping the public informed. We have been in the markets, mosques, churches, schools, on the radio and the television providing information on Ebola so health workers and regular people are armed with the knowledge to protect themselves and their children. To date, UNICEF and our partners in Guinea have reached over 3.2 million people. “Others call me, ‘Kadiatou the new born’—because I was given a second chance.” Timothy La Rose is a UNICEF Communication Specialist based in Conakry, Guinea.

Whatever brought you here, know that we have 6,666 codes to giveaway for what could potentially be the most innovative MMO since EVE Online. As in Star Wars: Galaxies and EVE Online, players in ArcheAge are free to create their own roles. You can become a landowner and rent that land out to other players who can then farm it for produce to sell on a player-run market. You can build a ship, either something small that you can captain on your own, or something larger which a crew of your friends can pilot. The Korean MMO is packed full of ideas and the best way to get a grasp of them is to play. To that end we’ve got thousands of lovely codes to give away. Something to note before entering your details in the widget below is that these aren’t Steam codes. You’ll need to go to the ArcheAge’s account page to redeem your key.

It’s more about making complementary colors work for you and using shades of color to drive the mood you want to create. Books of paint swatches will teach you nothing about this, but inspiration images certainly will! Here are 14 celebrities who’ve used color effectively in their homes and offices. Brooke Shields In her New York townhouse, which was decorated with the help of David Flint Wood, a British decorator and partner to India Hicks , actress Brooke Shields painted the walls in Benjamin Moore’s Chelsea Gray, which provides contrast for her heart-shaped Keith Haring painting. She added a touch of femininity with pink throw pillows and an attention-grabbing jolt with a bright green lampshade. Minnie Mortimer Fashion designer Minnie Mortimer had her priorities straight when she decorated her former Malibu, CA home, which was featured on Vogue.com . With big, wide, sun-filled windows looking out to lush trees, there’s no reason to detract from the view. So, she kept the walls white and furniture neutral, and integrated pops of color in pillows to lighten the mood. Kourtney Kardashian Reality star Kourtney Kardashian’s former Calabasas family home, which was featured on Domaine , had a lot going for it with geometric prints and sculptural lighting galore. In her office, she and her interior designer Jeff Andrews got down to business, keeping the color scheme simple with black walls and furniture. To brighten up the dark space, she used books, throw pillows, and a red hide chair. Molly Sims Model/actress Molly Sims’ Beverly Hills home, which was featured on Domaine , displays one of the greatest color techniques, which is looking to art for inspiration. The focal point of her LA living room, designed with Kishani Perera , is an acrylic painting with notes of yellow and turquoise. Sims and Perera created a neutral base with wooden furniture and brown upholstery, and then pulled in colors from the painting in accessories. Tory Burch The corporate offices of Tory Burch, as well as the fashion designer’s Southampton home , display truly effective use of color. In her weekend getaway, she mixes soft colors and neutrals to create a relaxing effect, and makes a sophisticated statement with silk coral curtains. In her office, she uses a trio of beautiful yet unique complementary colors — orange, green, and purple — to create a space that’s inspiring and stimulating. Jennifer Lopez Singer/actress and former In Living Color fly girl Jennifer Lopez knows how to put the guests in her cozy California residence at ease, and that’s with a soft, warm palette. She and interior designer Michelle Workman coated her guest bedroom in pastel peaches to create a space that looks downright heavenly. Tata Harper Beauty and skin care guru Tata Harper ’s compound in Shoreham, VT, which was featured in Elle , is mostly devoid of color, with off-white walls and natural woods. But in one sitting room and children’s play room, she took a carefree approach with lobster-colored walls, to match her red tufted sofa, and a purposefully clashing purple and blue rug. It’s just the kind of laidback color choice a farmhouse needs. Diane von Furstenberg Wrap-dress pioneer Diane von Furstenberg is a strong, confident woman, and the interiors of all of her homes reflect that. In her live/work space in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District, the fashion designer painted her walls a rosy pink to match her vintage Salvador Dalí lip sofa. The result is fearless, feminine, and nothing but fabulous. Jenna Lyons J.Crew president and creative director Jenna Lyons has color in her DNA; after all, she directs which shade of cashmere we’ll pick up, season after season. In her former Brooklyn townhouse , which was featured in Domino , the creative painted her walls a soft gray to draw attention to her home’s stunning architectural details. With most accents in black and white, she made one beautiful focal point with a statement-making lemon-yellow sofa. Jessica Alba Actress and entrepreneur Jessica Alba created a cool, calm atmosphere in the offices of her brand, The Honest Company , using fresh, timeless colors: Tiffany blue and dark teal. The space feels as happy as can be — just how a workplace should. In her husband Cash Warren’s man cave , designed by Kari Whitman , she spoke to its masculine identity with a moody deep blue wall color. Cameron Diaz Actress Cameron Diaz hired interior designer Kelly Wearstler to decorate her West Village, NY apartment, which was featured in ELLE Decor , and the pair selected a gorgeous emerald-green hue for her kitchen cabinets. It pairs perfectly with the kitchen’s copper backsplash, and it’s understated yet unique enough to make a statement. Melanie Griffith Actress Melanie Griffith and her decorator Kari Whitman were inspired by Griffith’s Banksy artwork to paint the paneling of her dining room high-gloss black. Black is certainly an unusual choice for a dining room, but the lacquer gives a bit of sparkle. And with a sultry, moody air, it feels like a place where dinner parties linger long into the evening. Kelly Wearstler Maximalist interior and accessories designer Kelly Wearstler doesn’t usually use bright colors, but she nailed it with this yellow and raspberry bedroom. The colors complement each other and are anchored by classic blacks and whites. The trick here is that she introduced texture rather than crazy patterns, which could have been too much.

Illinois is expected to receive $84 million of the total, about half of which will compensate pension funds for investment losses. One local headline on the news read “Citi deal lets Illinois recoup pension losses.” That’s a relief.  $44 million is a lot of money.  Is Illinois out of the woods? The chart below is a pie chart with two slices.  The black slice represents the $44 million that will be paid to Illinois pension funds.  The yellow slice has what Truth in Accounting unearthed from the state’s 2013 financial reports for the unfunded pension obligations owed to Illinois state government retirees – which came to $100.5 billion. There are two reasons you can just barely see the $44 million black slice.  First, you shouldn’t even see it at all – when you use $44 million in the software, it doesn’t even show up in the chart.  We had to fake it with a much bigger number to get it to show up.  That’s because of the second reason — $44 million is a very, very small amount of money compared to the $100.5 billion the state needs to fund its unfunded retirement pension obligations. This is how deep a hole Illinois dug for its citizens and taxpayers. The hole is so deep partly because governments, their accountants, and a wider set of special interest groups have long found it politically expedient to leave unfunded retirement benefits out of public financial statements and “balanced budget” calculations. Unfortunately, the reckoning day is dawning.  That’s one way to think of that big yellow ball up there.  Let’s hope it doesn’t turn into a sunset.

Other top ways to take advantage of a gorgeous summer night in Philadelphia include an abundance of free outdoor movie screenings for folks of all ages. Tonight, The Oval screens School of Rock , Hawthorne Park hosts a free screening of The Lego Movie and Lovett Library Park hosts Charlie and the Chocolate Factory .
